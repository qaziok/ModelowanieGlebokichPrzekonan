I am triple vaccinated against covid. I still think mask mandates are better than vaccine ‚Äúpassport‚Äù mandates. Aerosol scientists say masks are very effective at preventing the spread. I hate masks. But I also can‚Äôt afford to get covid. Who can, really?!
is it too late to get the vaccine i really don't want covid
383,664 COVID Cases on a single day in South Korea! (@nytimes) What's happening elsewhere can happen in your backyard. We can't help South Korea put out the fire, but we must take precautions in the U.S. @POTUS  Stay up-to-date with your vaccine schedule. Wear a mask. #MaskUp
Why is it that the people who tirelessly campaigned for "back to normal" never campaign for ventilation, or better sick pay or masks or to combat vaccine disinformation - the things that would reduce covid burden as other mitigations are removed?
I hate how people are saying the vaccine is what caused Hailey Bieber to have a blood clot in her brain "Young people never had those before the covid vaccine!!" yes they did, a lot of young people have strokes actually
5th day in bed with fucking Covid.   Thankful for the vaccine, furious at all the jackass officials who drop mask mandates including my employer @Columbia.   What on earth do you have to loose in keeping the damn masks on for a few more months?
On the 2nd anniversary of #covid, i would like to thank Moderna and Pfizer for producing the vaccine. Where would we be if there was no vaccine? Thanks to all scientists and medical staff around the world #covid #cdnpoli #yeg #abpoli #CovidIsNotOver

.@OlafScholz today marks two years since the @WHO declared #Covid a global pandemic. We could have been celebrating the end of the #global #pandemic. But Big pharmaceutical corporations still haven‚Äôt shared vaccine patents. @Bundeskanzlerz change that and #EndCOVIDMonopolies!
In hindsight, no one could have predicted that a COVID vaccine would accelerate the end of lockdowns.
I know Im for sale by chocolate pony by the bathroom* yeah...I got the covid vaccine I can be part of the fire but I dont actually have a name to search for &amp;gt;:(
so tired of being stuck in bed. Never fully recovered from getting blasted by my covid vaccine and i still have to get another one on the 18th (:
Pfizer is close to submitting data to the Food and Drug Administration on a fourth dose of its COVID-19 vaccine.  ‚ÄúClearly there is a need in an environment of omicron to boost the immune response,‚Äù he told CNBC in an interview Friday.
This time last year I was shielding and being bumped up the vaccine list.  Restrictions gone in England for 3 weeks and now I have covid, despite being particularly careful  Even "mild" version has completely floored me and no let up yet.  Who is the pandemic over for exactly?
I am back from taking the third shot of the covid vaccine.
Had my fourth vaccine dose at end of December. Had an antibody test on 16 Feb which showed a very strong vaccine response (&gt;2,500 U/mL). Tested positive for COVID this morning ü§∑üèºu200d‚ôÄÔ∏è
#KeepMasking Keep your guards up COVID still out Everyday a new study is showing the long term damage caused by COVID The vaccine give you better chance at fighting the infection, it's not a forcefield to keep the virus away The mask is your shield  Better mask = Better shield
I guess I won‚Äôt be comfortable until we have a &gt;80% rate of success vaccine for COVID that is ‚úîÔ∏èAvailable for ages 0-100 ‚úîÔ∏èMandatory
Covid-19 in the UK    73.3% with two vaccine doses and 57.3% with booster top-up  Daily cases* 72,898 In hospital 11,944 Daily deaths* 114  Daily cases are increasing - be safe
Feel like I got hit by a car after getting that Covid vaccine
If you‚Äôve ever dropped an AirPod on the streets of NYC and put it back in your ear you don‚Äôt have to worry about what‚Äôs in the COVID vaccine
Running the numbers for a sixth time the results keep saying the same thing the Covid vaccine made me gay
Covid is only out of the limelight. Restrictions are still in place. Mandates to take the vaccine or lose your job and basic privileges are in place. And bills are moving through to make them permanent, especially in Cali are moving through. It‚Äôs a diversion. Don‚Äôt let it go.
Day 5 of Covid feel tired and washed out. Vaccine working as still able to function not as bad as flu
#COVID19: #Gujarat in 24 hours vaccinated 10,763 persons for the first dose and 50,480 for the second. In all, 5.21 crore are administered first and 4.95 crore second dose of Covid vaccine #GujaratCoronaUpdate #covidvaccination
My dad would definitely have long covid if he hadn't had his third shot &amp; he would definitely be dead if he had no vaccine.  He still may get long covid.   Freedom
Florida's surgeon general breaks with CDC advice, says the state will be the first to ‚Äúofficially recommend against the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children‚Äù
One year ago today I received my first dose of the COVID vaccine.
Why do you think the companies &amp; govt have suddenly dropped covid vaccine mandates?  Hint: Its not because of omicron but Pfizer data.
It was a lost Saturday. Had to spend two days in bed to recuperate from Pfizer #3, the first booster of the COVID vaccine.
Covid update: I don't feel the horrible feeling in my chest anymore. Even went for a (solo distanced) walk today! I have a sore throat, runny nose and keep sneezing. I am honestly quite shocked at how mild I'm experiencing it and so grateful for my 3 doses of vaccine. üí™
That's more people coming down with covid round here , they have all had vaccine jags, so they don't seem to be as bad, still ill but not dying so that's a good sign, more time and we can hopefully find even better treatment.
Covid is kicking my arse. Weird symptoms like immense forehead pain, sensitive skin, red cheeks, cold hands and feet, sweating like a demon. Fuck doing this without a vaccine. I‚Äôm so thankful I let Bill Gates put a microchip in me üôåüèª
I'm extra af so i'm making sure I have my vaccine card AND a negative covid test
Phew - my 13yo actually made it to his 2nd vaccine dose without catching Covid for a third time (1st 2 infections coincided with the week of his 1st vaccine dose, and the week before he was supposed to have his 2nd). Just need to get through the next 2 weeks of immunity-building.
I have a question.   Was it wrong to call CoVID shots a ‚ÄúVaccine‚Äù..   It‚Äòs not a vaccine as most reasonable people would interpret that word.   (yes I‚Äôve had my 3 shots)
Recent release of #Pfizer #COVID-19 #vaccine #documents sparked a flurry of news stories. Many of them referenced data released previously (November 2021) showing Pfizer reported to the U.S. #FDA Food and Drug Administration that the drugmaker was aware of 1,223 reports of deaths
I received the J&amp;J COVID vaccine and the Moderna booster as soon as I was eligible for each. I‚Äôve masked and social distanced per CDC direction.   So far I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve contracted COVID 19. All my COVID tests have been negative and I‚Äôve had no symptoms.
I swear, some people on the right don't want the vaccine to be effective so they can say "I told you so" and some people on the left don't want it to be effective because they seem to hate the thought of any good news in regard to covid. Fuck yous both. The vaccine works.
just got my second covid vaccine
Why did the Pope relieve Bishop Daniel Fern√°ndez Torres? All news reports I look up online state one reason was the Bishop had sanctuary for individuals who did not want covid vaccine. I feel the Catholic religion has a false Pope.
Getting Covid is still bad. We should all still be doing everything we can to keep from getting it or spreading it. All the long term complications are still unknown but the ones we do know about are bad. Oh, and the vaccine is safe.
:: why did I have a dream that there was a new Covid vaccine that actually prevents everyone from getting it???
Fourth dose of covid vaccine now available for over 80s in France.
Oh, it‚Äôs twelve weeks since a positive test or first vaccine for under 18s ‚Ä¶ not four. Ethan‚Äôs second jab will be in May then (unless they get Covid again, of course).
A booster dose is the additional dose of the COVID-19 vaccine taken after the full dose of any brand of the vaccine for further protection against the virus.  #YesToCOVID19Vaccine #COVID19VaccineIsSafe #GoForCOVIDVaccineToday
Mom's home help couldn't get her COVID-19 vaccine booster dose as MySejahtera hadn't updated her second dose as being received back in Aug 2021. Thanks to the kiosk at WTC, this finally got rectified. In and out in 15 mins. Thank you @my_sejahtera @KKMPutrajaya and @Khairykj

Got my second shot of the #covid vaccine.
What amazes me is people are defending Pfizer/gvmnt and saying the fatality rate of ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù is only .1%..  At it worst, Actual Covid fatality is .06% ‚Ä¶  Seems catching Covid has better chances to live than taking the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù ‚Ä¶  Come on!!

1yr ago today I got my first dose of the Covid vaccine üò≥
This @toryboypierce is a joke. Who isnt scared of covid ? Clearly 100s millions of people took the covid vaccine because they enjoy vaccinations rather than because they are scared of covid. #lbc what an idiot
BREAKING: Austrian Government SUSPENDS Covid-19 Vaccine Mandate For ALL ADULTS, just days before the law becomes effective throughout the country.
When people state that deaths after a covid vaccine are just coincidental are the same people that stated a positive test result was a covid death.
Austrian Government Suspends Mandatory Covid-19 Vaccine For All Adults.
tw/ cw covid vaccine  i‚Äôm getting my second covid vaccine kinda nervous ngl
I received my 2 Covid vaccine shots last year &amp; a booster shot earlier in the year.  So Kyrie, I don't know what's up with you not getting vaccinated, but this @BrooklynNets basketball team needs you full time &amp; playing home games again. GET YOUR A$$ VACCINATED &amp; FOLLOW THE LAW!
I am SO happy that my 8-year-old was finally offered a covid vaccine this week - and also in awe of just how hard everyone at the vaccine centre worked to make it a good experience for the kids. Stickers! Ginger biscuits! Where's Wally colouring sheets! Nurses dressed as Olaf! üíï
English diary Day 352. I got some strong side effectsü§í from the COVID-19 vaccineüíâ than last time. But I'm fineüòÄ now. #LearnEnglish #englishlearner #twinglish #diary
10th day living w covid : diarrhoea and vomiting. Sangat terseksa, couldn‚Äôt think how would I be without vaccine. Mesti lagi terseksa.
Sup,covid! Daydrinking is a essential routine of staying sane in order to not go crazy during covid time, My human once told me a story:  Charlie, who is a  doctor, he  saved people's lives in the pandemic, and he  invented the vaccine
People will really be like ‚Äúmy body my choice‚Äù about the vaccine and then monologue about how you should stop with the masks already because they had COVID and it‚Äôs not that badüôÉ
I administered a Covid vaccine last week and was told to toss the remainder because ‚Äúthe pandemic is just about over‚Äù and no one comes in for them anymore.There were TONS that were gonna be thrown out as well once the expiration date approached.I feel like we should be sharing üåé
Facebook reminded me that a year ago today I got my first Covid vaccine.
just went to get my second vaccine and they said i couldn‚Äôt get it cos i‚Äôve had covid in the last 12 weeks but i got told i could get it after 28 days üëçüèªüëçüèª
SECOND COVID VACCINE DONE WOOOOOOO  no gender awakening this time
There are still ~1500 COVID deaths/day in the US. Total deaths from the 9/11 attack: 2996. And yet, 20 years later, Americans still accept high airport security, intrusive pat-downs, seizure of banned items - while they protest mask and vaccine mandates in an ongoing pandemic. ü§∑u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è
Out of all 3 Covid vaccine shots, my arm has only been sore for the booster ü•¥
