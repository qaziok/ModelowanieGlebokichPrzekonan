1yr ago today I got my first dose of the Covid vaccine 😳
That's more people coming down with covid round here , they have all had vaccine jags, so they don't seem to be as bad, still ill but not dying so that's a good sign, more time and we can hopefully find even better treatment.
I am triple vaccinated against covid. I still think mask mandates are better than vaccine “passport” mandates. Aerosol scientists say masks are very effective at preventing the spread. I hate masks. But I also can’t afford to get covid. Who can, really?!
Running the numbers for a sixth time the results keep saying the same thing the Covid vaccine made me gay
Mom's home help couldn't get her COVID-19 vaccine booster dose as MySejahtera hadn't updated her second dose as being received back in Aug 2021. Thanks to the kiosk at WTC, this finally got rectified. In and out in 15 mins. Thank you @my_sejahtera @KKMPutrajaya and @Khairykj
Why is it that the people who tirelessly campaigned for "back to normal" never campaign for ventilation, or better sick pay or masks or to combat vaccine disinformation - the things that would reduce covid burden as other mitigations are removed?
:: why did I have a dream that there was a new Covid vaccine that actually prevents everyone from getting it???
Got my second shot of the #covid vaccine.
5th day in bed with fucking Covid.   Thankful for the vaccine, furious at all the jackass officials who drop mask mandates including my employer @Columbia.   What on earth do you have to loose in keeping the damn masks on for a few more months?
India’s COVID-19 vaccination coverage has crossed 180 Crore (1,80,10,69,235) today. More than 17 lakh (17,82,501) vaccine doses have been administered till 7 pm today: Union Health Ministry
Why did the Pope relieve Bishop Daniel Fernández Torres? All news reports I look up online state one reason was the Bishop had sanctuary for individuals who did not want covid vaccine. I feel the Catholic religion has a false Pope.
I am back from taking the third shot of the covid vaccine.
I am SO happy that my 8-year-old was finally offered a covid vaccine this week - and also in awe of just how hard everyone at the vaccine centre worked to make it a good experience for the kids. Stickers! Ginger biscuits! Where's Wally colouring sheets! Nurses dressed as Olaf! 💕
.@OlafScholz today marks two years since the @WHO declared #Covid a global pandemic. We could have been celebrating the end of the #global #pandemic. But Big pharmaceutical corporations still haven’t shared vaccine patents. @Bundeskanzlerz change that and #EndCOVIDMonopolies!
SECOND COVID VACCINE DONE WOOOOOOO  no gender awakening this time
Oh, it’s twelve weeks since a positive test or first vaccine for under 18s … not four. Ethan’s second jab will be in May then (unless they get Covid again, of course).
One year ago today I received my first dose of the COVID vaccine.
I know Im for sale by chocolate pony by the bathroom* yeah...I got the covid vaccine I can be part of the fire but I dont actually have a name to search for &amp;gt;:(
Austrian Government Suspends Mandatory Covid-19 Vaccine For All Adults.
Covid-19 in the UK    73.3% with two vaccine doses and 57.3% with booster top-up  Daily cases* 72,898 In hospital 11,944 Daily deaths* 114  Daily cases are increasing - be safe
10th day living w covid : diarrhoea and vomiting. Sangat terseksa, couldn’t think how would I be without vaccine. Mesti lagi terseksa.
just went to get my second vaccine and they said i couldn’t get it cos i’ve had covid in the last 12 weeks but i got told i could get it after 28 days 👍🏻👍🏻
What amazes me is people are defending Pfizer/gvmnt and saying the fatality rate of “vaccine” is only .1%..  At it worst, Actual Covid fatality is .06% …  Seems catching Covid has better chances to live than taking the “vaccine” …  Come on!!

Pfizer is close to submitting data to the Food and Drug Administration on a fourth dose of its COVID-19 vaccine.  “Clearly there is a need in an environment of omicron to boost the immune response,” he told CNBC in an interview Friday.
Covid is only out of the limelight. Restrictions are still in place. Mandates to take the vaccine or lose your job and basic privileges are in place. And bills are moving through to make them permanent, especially in Cali are moving through. It’s a diversion. Don’t let it go.
Recent release of #Pfizer #COVID-19 #vaccine #documents sparked a flurry of news stories. Many of them referenced data released previously (November 2021) showing Pfizer reported to the U.S. #FDA Food and Drug Administration that the drugmaker was aware of 1,223 reports of deaths
In hindsight, no one could have predicted that a COVID vaccine would accelerate the end of lockdowns.
On the 2nd anniversary of #covid, i would like to thank Moderna and Pfizer for producing the vaccine. Where would we be if there was no vaccine? Thanks to all scientists and medical staff around the world #covid #cdnpoli #yeg #abpoli #CovidIsNotOver
#COVID19: #Gujarat in 24 hours vaccinated 10,763 persons for the first dose and 50,480 for the second. In all, 5.21 crore are administered first and 4.95 crore second dose of Covid vaccine #GujaratCoronaUpdate #covidvaccination
I have a question.   Was it wrong to call CoVID shots a “Vaccine”..   It‘s not a vaccine as most reasonable people would interpret that word.   (yes I’ve had my 3 shots)
just got my second covid vaccine
People will really be like “my body my choice” about the vaccine and then monologue about how you should stop with the masks already because they had COVID and it’s not that bad🙃
I swear, some people on the right don't want the vaccine to be effective so they can say "I told you so" and some people on the left don't want it to be effective because they seem to hate the thought of any good news in regard to covid. Fuck yous both. The vaccine works.
Why do you think the companies &amp; govt have suddenly dropped covid vaccine mandates?  Hint: Its not because of omicron but Pfizer data.

A booster dose is the additional dose of the COVID-19 vaccine taken after the full dose of any brand of the vaccine for further protection against the virus.  #YesToCOVID19Vaccine #COVID19VaccineIsSafe #GoForCOVIDVaccineToday
#KeepMasking Keep your guards up COVID still out Everyday a new study is showing the long term damage caused by COVID The vaccine give you better chance at fighting the infection, it's not a forcefield to keep the virus away The mask is your shield  Better mask = Better shield
My dad would definitely have long covid if he hadn't had his third shot &amp; he would definitely be dead if he had no vaccine.  He still may get long covid.   Freedom
This @toryboypierce is a joke. Who isnt scared of covid ? Clearly 100s millions of people took the covid vaccine because they enjoy vaccinations rather than because they are scared of covid. #lbc what an idiot
Day 5 of Covid feel tired and washed out. Vaccine working as still able to function not as bad as flu
Facebook reminded me that a year ago today I got my first Covid vaccine.
When people state that deaths after a covid vaccine are just coincidental are the same people that stated a positive test result was a covid death.
Fourth dose of covid vaccine now available for over 80s in France.
Had my fourth vaccine dose at end of December. Had an antibody test on 16 Feb which showed a very strong vaccine response (&gt;2,500 U/mL). Tested positive for COVID this morning 🤷🏼u200d♀️
Out of all 3 Covid vaccine shots, my arm has only been sore for the booster 🥴
BREAKING: Austrian Government SUSPENDS Covid-19 Vaccine Mandate For ALL ADULTS, just days before the law becomes effective throughout the country.
It was a lost Saturday. Had to spend two days in bed to recuperate from Pfizer #3, the first booster of the COVID vaccine.
is it too late to get the vaccine i really don't want covid
There are still ~1500 COVID deaths/day in the US. Total deaths from the 9/11 attack: 2996. And yet, 20 years later, Americans still accept high airport security, intrusive pat-downs, seizure of banned items - while they protest mask and vaccine mandates in an ongoing pandemic. 🤷u200d♀️
This time last year I was shielding and being bumped up the vaccine list.  Restrictions gone in England for 3 weeks and now I have covid, despite being particularly careful  Even "mild" version has completely floored me and no let up yet.  Who is the pandemic over for exactly?
tw/ cw covid vaccine  i’m getting my second covid vaccine kinda nervous ngl
🇦🇹 Austrian Government SUSPENDS Covid-19 Vaccine Mandate For ALL ADULTS, just days before the law becomes effective throughout the country! 👌🏻
English diary Day 352. I got some strong side effects🤒 from the COVID-19 vaccine💉 than last time. But I'm fine😀 now. #LearnEnglish #englishlearner #twinglish #diary
Sup,covid! Daydrinking is a essential routine of staying sane in order to not go crazy during covid time, My human once told me a story:  Charlie, who is a  doctor, he  saved people's lives in the pandemic, and he  invented the vaccine
