All with the intent to force everyone to be vaccinated. The question is why? Let's start with the vaccine itself. The results in Israel prove what a sham, charade and fraud this all is. The U.S. government and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention argue that the vaccine is our only chance to survive. And that people are hospitalized and dying with COVID-19 because they are unvaccinated. Both arguments are pure fraud.  First, are you aware that anyone who dies within 14 days of getting vaccinated is considered ""unvaccinated""? No wonder they claim everyone who is dying is unvaccinated. If you die from COVID-19, whether you're vaccinated or unvaccinated, they just call you unvaccinated.  If a businessperson in the private sector tried that scam, they'd spend the next 20 years in prison for fraud.  The CDC has also been using stats of COVID-19 deaths going back to January to make the claim that the deaths are almost exclusively among the unvaccinated. That's because earlier in the year almost everyone was unvaccinated. That's called rigging the numbers. The CDC must be using the same Democrats who rigged and stole the 2020 election.  Worst of all, the media has blacked out the developing disaster in Israel. Israel is the most vaccinated country in the world. They all got the Pfizer vaccine. At first, deaths and hospitalizations went to almost zero. Israel declared victory over COVID-19.  But everything changed. Today a massive COVID-19 outbreak has engulfed vaccinated Israel. Hospitals are full. People are dying. At this moment, Israel, the most vaccinated nation in the world, has more COVID-19 infections per capita than any country in the world.  At this moment, 0.2% of the entire population of Israel is catching COVID-19 each day.  This past week was the worst week for COVID-19 in Israel EVER. Israel is setting records for vaccinated people in the hospital. Deaths are skyrocketing.  It's so bad, no-mask, no-lockdown Sweden has just banned travelers from Israel. Many EU countries are following suit.  The vaccine isn't just failing, it's a spectacular fail. It wore off. It no longer works. And just as my holistic doctor friends predicted, it makes the next wave far worse. These doctors say vaccinated people are far more contagious; they carry heavier viral loads and are far more susceptible to getting severe illness than someone with ""natural immunity.""  This experiment with an ""experimental, emergency-use-only"" vaccine is a great big failure. A dangerous and deadly failure.  But at this very moment, Biden, the CDC and the U.S. media are pushing the vaccine, vaccine mandates and vaccine passports harder than ever. The question is why?  Why is forcing every American to get vaccinated so important at the exact moment Israel proves the vaccine they're pushing is a dramatic, dangerous and deadly failure?  And it's not just Israel. In the UK, a majority of the COVID-19 deaths last month were among vaccinated people. And the UK death rate from COVID-19 today is dramatically higher than a year ago -- when there was no vaccine.  Separate from all that, the VAERS vaccine reporting system reports the vaccine itself is causing tremendous rates of death and crippling injuries. So, vaccinated Americans are dying and becoming severely sick from the vaccine, in addition to dying and becoming severely sick from COVID-19 after getting the vaccine.  And none of this is featured in the news. It's a total media blackout.  Worse yet, the same government, CDC and media are trying desperately to denigrate and slander the drug that is most successful in treating COVID-19. It's called ivermectin. In my next column, I'll show you conclusive proof from around the world that ivermectin is miraculously effective versus COVID-19.  Something is very wrong. It sure seems like someone is scared you might actually recover from COVID-19, doesn't it?"																
2	0	"This week has been eye-opening. Even for me -- and I'm the guy who has warned for over a year, in commentary after commentary, and often for three hours a day on my nationally syndicated radio show, that the COVID-19 vaccine could be dangerous and deadly and could lead to catastrophe. I stuck my neck out like no other talk show host in America to warn the vaccine may not even prevent illness; in fact, it could damage the immune system, thereby causing more illness and death. And not just from COVID-19, but also injuries and death linked to the COVID-19 vaccine itself.Eight months ago, I warned it was time to suspend the vaccine program pending an investigation of mounting deaths, grievous injuries and permanent disabilities. I titled my commentary, ""What if This Experimental COVID Shot Is Killing People? Don't Americans Have a Right To Know?""Four months ago, I was courageous enough to scold New York Times medical reporters about the unfolding disaster that they have ignored. I titled my commentary, ""What I Just Told the New York Times About the Complete Failure and Disaster of the COVID-19 Vaccine.""Three months ago, I was the first to warn that Americans were dropping in record numbers of heart attacks, strokes and blood clots. I titled my commentary, ""If the Vaccine Is So Great, Why Are So Many People Dropping Dead?""But even I was shocked by the plethora of stories coming out just in the past week, from all corners of the world, suggesting the vaccines are indeed a terrible failure and are causing a mass die-off.Here is a quick look at the FACTS that have come pouring out of the closet just in the past week:Israel is the most vaccinated major nation in the world. Almost the entire population is quadruple vaccinated. Yet right now Israel is No. 1 in the world for COVID-19 infections. Over one half of 1% of their entire population is testing positive for COVID-19 PER DAY. In Germany, the most draconian COVID-19 mandates and restrictions in the world were sold to the public with false data. Just like in America, the German government labeled this a ""pandemic of the unvaccinated."" They claimed up to 90% of the infected and dead were unvaccinated. Newspaper investigations have found that none of this was true. The government simply classified every sick or dying person as ""unvaccinated."" Government officials are apologizing, blaming the ""mistake"" on a ""software error.""In Alberta, Canada, the government published, then quickly deleted health data exposing that almost 60% of the COVID-19 victims classified as ""unvaccinated"" were actually among the vaccinated. It turns out everyone who got sick, was hospitalized or died within two weeks of getting any vaccine (the first jab, or second, or third) was counted as ""unvaccinated.""I'll bet you didn't know the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention play the exact same trick here in the USA. They know most of the COVID-19 deaths and injuries, not to mention deaths from the vaccine itself (mostly heart attacks) will occur within 14 days of any jab. So, everyone that gets sick or dies in that period is counted as ""unvaccinated."" The most perfect control group ever is the U.S. military. Every young soldier got the COVID-19 vaccine in the past year. To follow the results is the very definition of SCIENCE. Military whistleblowers have come forward with Department of Defense medical data showing since the start of the vaccine program cancer is up about 300% among military members; female infertility is up 500%; miscarriages are up by 300%; and there was an astronomical 1000% increase in neurological disorders from 82,000 to 863,000 in one year.These are young men and women who were in perfect health ... until the vaccines. It appears the vaccines are literally crippling our national defense.One more control group of formerly healthy young men and women: FIFA soccer players in the EU. Deaths from cardiac arrest increased by 500% in 2021. An astounding 183 professional athletes and coaches collapsed ""suddenly"" in 2021. Worst of all is the news from the CDC that non-COVID-19 deaths in the age range of 18 to 49 increased by 40% in the past year. No one has ever seen anything like this. Why are working-age Americans dying in record numbers? Only one thing changed in 2021: vaccine mandates at the workplace. The real story these numbers tell is we are experiencing a ""pandemic of the vaccinated."" I believe the vaccine is doing catastrophic damage, but governments, politicians and bureaucrats the world over have falsely labeled vaccinated people who are sick and dying as ""unvaccinated."" And the media covers up the truth like it's Hunter Biden's laptop.This is the greatest scam in world history. It would make Bernie Madoff blush."																
3	0	"Yes, it's true. I beat COVID-19 in 48 hours with ivermectin. Before I get to that story, I have more news guaranteed to make liberals' heads explode.I was married last week. That has to enrage liberals. The Left hates marriage. But they really hate it when a man who knows he's a man marries a feminine woman who knows she's a woman. I married the stunning, beautiful, sexy, Cindy Parker.This was truly a Republican wedding.My new wife is on the Board of Directors of many Republican organizations in Nevada. We had a large wedding with 200 guests from all over the USA -- almost all Republicans, conservatives and patriots. I remarked to the crowd, ""There are so many Republican politicians in this room, we could hold a Republican National Committee meeting right here.""I opened the wedding by asking all the military veterans and law enforcement in the room to stand up. My guests gave them a standing ovation.There were no masks. I'm guessing most of the crowd was unvaccinated. We were guarded by former Navy SEALs from the finest security firm in Las Vegas.If liberals' heads haven't exploded just yet, here's the clincher. The highlight of our wedding was former Fox News host and bestselling author Rita Cosby reading a personal, handwritten letter from former President Donald Trump celebrating our wedding.Want to watch liberals' heads triple explode? Here's the best story yet. I was healthy and strong at my wedding because of ivermectin.I caught COVID-19 for the first time a few weeks ago.I beat COVID-19 in 48 hours with ivermectin and massive doses of vitamins -- including intravenous vitamin C.But ivermectin is truly a miracle drug. I had COVID-19 for a day when I decided to take ivermectin. From that point on, COVID-19 was gone in 24 hours. Yes, ivermectin and vitamins turned the dangerous, deadly, run-for-your-life, lock-down-the-economy, mask-up-for-life, vaccinate-or-die COVID-19 into a minor common cold. And then it was gone in 24 hours.Ivermectin made my COVID-19 bout so mild, I never missed a day of work. Yes, I hosted my three-hour national radio show every day, with COVID-19 -- and no one noticed.Wait, it gets better. My book, ""The Great Patriot Protest & Boycott Book,"" is out and I was on a book tour promoting the book. I was a guest (over the phone) on over 20 radio shows that week, with COVID-19 -- and no one noticed.And I appeared on multiple national television shows (via Zoom or Skype) that week to promote my book, with COVID-19 -- and no one noticed.Ivermectin and megadoses of vitamins turned deadly COVID-19 into a minor cold that never slowed me one bit. No one could even tell I was sick.But lest you think I got a mild case: not true. On the first day of COVID-19, I had fever, chills, a bad cough, mucus filling my lungs, awful pain in every muscle of my body, terrible exhaustion, and I lost my sense of taste. Sound familiar? It's every symptom of COVID-19. I took two COVID-19 tests just to be certain. I tested positive twice.One day of ivermectin and it was gone. No one ever knew. Until now.My treatment was pretty much exactly the same as Joe Rogan and NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Ivermectin plus megadoses of vitamins. The outcomes were the same, too.Ivermectin works like magic. It's inexpensive. I never experienced any side effects. I thank God for ivermectin and megadoses of vitamins C and D3, zinc, quercetin, selenium, lysine, melatonin, garlic, liquid silver and probiotics.No one has to fear COVID-19. No one needs to be forced to take a dangerous, experimental vaccine. No one ever has to choose between the vaccine or their job ever again. We have a miracle drug and a wonderful vitamin regimen that works fantastically against COVID-19.I'm Exhibit A.Hey, liberals, are you listening? Have your heads exploded yet?Ivermectin worked for me -- cheaply and with no side effects. India used it to make the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the world disappear almost overnight. So did Mexico City. So did Japan. So, why are President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention trying to hide the truth?I believe ivermectin could save millions of Americans from COVID-19. Ivermectin can save our economy. Ivermectin can save millions of jobs. Ivermectin could save trillions of dollars in costs from missed work, vaccines, hospitalizations and death.I beat COVID-19 in 48 hours with ivermectin plus vitamins. No one has to die from COVID-19. I'm playing the role of Paul Revere. ""The ivermectin is coming, the ivermectin is coming."" I want the whole world to know."																
4	0	"The COVID-19 vaccines appear to be causing a global health disaster. There are so many warnings from all around the world. I'll list just a few in this column. But the U.S. media remains silent. They're as quiet as a church mouse. Why?Japan's Ministry of Health just announced that ""the Moderna and Pfizer Covid vaccines could cause heart-related side effects in younger males."" Health experts in Japan have witnessed skyrocketing rates of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men and teenagers. And they've seen the same nonstop heart issues with middle-aged and older individuals.All over America, and all over the world, cardiac arrest, heart inflammation and heart attack deaths are exploding. Young athletes are dropping right on the field; star soccer players in Europe are dropping dead in the middle of games; referees, coaches and even fans in the stands are having cardiac emergencies. It's something no one has ever seen before. It's an epidemic.What do all these victims have in common? They've all been vaccinated.In America, the media is filled with reports of hospital emergency rooms and intensive care units overwhelmed with seriously ill patients. From coast to coast, there are so many sick people lined up that there aren't enough beds or nurses. Sick patients are lying on gurneys along the hallways. Doctors and medical experts call it a ""mystery"" why so many Americans are sick. They can't understand what's happening.But I can solve the mystery. I believe that these are COVID-19 vaccine-related injuries overwhelming ERs and ICUs. The very illnesses that are most prevalent in this mysterious health emergency -- heart attack deaths, cardiac arrest, strokes, blood clots, multiple organ failure -- are all the same COVID-19 vaccine side effects listed in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).What a coincidence.But it's not just in the USA. It's happening everywhere. In the U.K., the Evening Standard newspaper reports up to 300,000 British citizens are facing sudden heart related illness and cardiac arrest.U.K. medical experts are blaming PPSD -- ""post-pandemic stress disorder."" Three hundred thousand Brits aren't dying and crippled from the vaccine. Of course not. They're all nuts. It's all in their heads.These brainwashed Kool-Aid drinkers can't see what's right in front of their faces. Or perhaps doctors, scientists and researchers are too afraid of losing their medical licenses, or losing multimillion-dollar government grants, to speak up.In the case of the media, it's all about greed. Big Pharma buys a large proportion of the ads on every TV news network in America. Offend Big Pharma with stories of vaccine deaths and injuries, and the media could lose billions of dollars in revenue. Half the newsroom could be fired.Not to mention stock prices would collapse in these media companies. There go the retirement accounts of Lester Holt, Don Lemon, Sean Hannity and Rachel Maddow. So, the truth is hard to come by.What's the truth? All anyone with a shred of credibility, morality and decency have to look at are a few key factors.First, the Food and Drug Administration has reportedly requested 75 years to fully release the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine data. If I told you to ""Trust me, I'm selling the world's best health tonic, but I can't disclose any of the test results or ingredients for 75 years, until everyone asking is dead,"" would you trust me? Would you buy what I was selling? Would you inject it into your body?Second, a federal judge demanded some of that data be released immediately by Pfizer. Just in the first few pages, detailing results from just the first few weeks of vaccines, Pfizer admits in their own data that their vaccine was linked to fatal outcomes for 1,223 Americans and produced 42,086 reports of adverse effects. Among the most prominent adverse effects were heart attacks and heart problems.Third, the VAERS system is reporting a number of adverse effects possibly linked to the vaccines -- including tens of thousands of hospitalizations, crippling injuries and permanent disabilities. That's just in America. The EU numbers are even higher.Now let me let you in on a terrible secret. My insider health care sources are reporting so many victims are filing reports with VAERS that the system is hopelessly overwhelmed and backed up. There may be 20,000 or 40,000 or 60,000 more deaths waiting to be processed into the VAERS system. They tell me the numbers are staggering.Now you know why hospital ERs and ICUs are overwhelmed with people who are seriously ill.So, my question is, shouldn't someone be investigating this escalating health disaster? Shouldn't someone in the media be reporting on this unimaginable tragedy? Should politicians be protecting us?One thing I know: Something very bad and very evil is happening."																
5	0	"Back in the 1980s, I was a Columbia University student learning about a plan to destroy America and end capitalism. It was called Cloward-Piven -- named after a Columbia University husband-and-wife professor team. Their insane goal was to turn America into a socialist, communist hellhole.They planned to do it by overwhelming and collapsing the U.S. economy with massive debt, created by getting as many Americans as possible to depend on welfare, food stamps and unemployment benefits. In the ensuing economic catastrophe and collapse of our country, every business owner would get on their knees to beg government to save them.At that moment of crisis and chaos, we would become a socialist, communist country.Don't look now, but it's happening. The communists of Columbia (and every other elitist Ivy League school) have tried for decades to force a majority of Americans to rely on welfare benefits. They failed. But they won't give up. They've modified the plan. It's now a powerful one-two punch.First, they've opened the borders to let millions of migrants and refugees into this country -- almost all of whom want cradle-to-grave welfare. Also, don't forget they all need free health care for themselves and their kids, and their new babies, and their extended families. That alone could overwhelm the system and collapse the economy. That's before welfare and food stamps. And then there's free public school for all their children and expensive English-as-a-second-language programs that cost billions of dollars but make teachers unions filthy rich.Open borders is Cloward-Piven strategy updated for 2021. And as the greatest bonus ever, Democrats know these millions of foreigners will loyally vote for the party who lets them in and then promises to give them the biggest welfare checks. These are lifetime Democrat voters.But there is now a powerful Part Deux to Cloward-Piven. Democrats aren't content to just welcome tens of millions of foreign welfare addicts into the USA. They want to make tens of millions of American-born citizens unemployed and dependent on government too.So, Part Deux of Cloward-Piven is the vaccine mandates.These COVID-19 vaccine mandates are destroying the country, creating chaos, crisis and division. They are wiping out the ranks of the police, fire, paramedics, nurses, prison guards, border patrol and military. Our middle class is being ripped to shreds. These frontline heroes and defenders don't want this dangerous, experimental, for-emergency-use-only jab. There will soon be no one to answer your 911 call. The police will be defunded -- without voters ever getting a vote.The military will be left weak and crippled. Wanna bet China is directing this plan? We all know China owns Biden and his family. Biden is serving up the country on a platter to China.The vaccine mandates also make the supply chain problems much worse. Truck drivers don't want the jab. They're quitting in droves. Jet pilots don't want the jab. They're on strike now -- ask Southwest and American Airlines why thousands of flights were grounded recently. If these pilots are fired, the tourism industry will be devastated. Shipping cargo by air will be devastated. Without pilots and truckers, food and supplies won't make it to stores. Shelves will be empty -- just like the old communist Soviet Union. Coincidence?Like I said, this is a communist takeover of the USA. Empty shelves are the hallmark of communism.And then there's the economy. If vaccine passports are mandated, restaurants, bars, nightclubs and retail stores will be crushed. Doubt me? Scotland's Hotel Association just announced a 40% drop in business from the vaccine passport. New York City's restaurants have announced the same size drop in business.Without the spending of tens of millions of my fellow Americans who choose to be unvaccinated, businesses will close by the millions. The economy will collapse.This is Cloward-Piven. It's real. It's happening. Democrats are purposely destroying and collapsing the economy. They're defunding the American middle class.It's time to fight back HARD. It's time to stop turning the other cheek. My new bestselling book, ""The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book,"" lays out the only possible strategy for conservative patriots -- CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, the strategy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. We have to hit these socialist, communist traitors and madmen squarely where it hurts -- in the pocketbook -- with national protests, strikes, boycotts and acts of civil disobedience. We must bankrupt them and bring them to their knees begging for forgiveness. Two can play at this game.The choice is clear: We either resist, or we lose America, our jobs, our careers, our middle-class quality of life, our health and everything that made America great. It's time to fight like animals, fight like it's the end of America, fight like our lives and the lives of our children are at stake ...Because they are."																
6	0	"So you got the vaccine because they told you to get it — or they forced you to get it — because as Joe Biden himself explained, it was your patriotic duty to get it to protect yourself and others. Good people do that.  The only way we can stop the spread of this virus and return to normal life is by taking the vaccines. If you get the shot, you can have hotdogs on the Fourth of July. Remember when he told you that? So you’d got the shot.  Now — surprise, surprise — they’re demanding that even after you got the shot, you wear a mask again, even when you’re outside. What’s going on here? Why are they doing this? There must be some reason for it. We’ve been wondering about it all week. Yesterday we asked the CDC to explain the reasoning behind it. They couldn’t tell us. Today they did. What an explanation. It turns out that the COVID vaccines — those wonder drugs that were absolutely perfect, more impressive than the moon landing, the drugs you were not allowed to question in any way — don’t actually work in the way they told us they did. The science is more complicated than we thought.  There’s still an awful lot we don’t know. These are, after all, experimental drugs, and they’re behaving like it. The bottom line is that a huge number of vaccinated people are getting COVID, and some of them are getting very sick, even dying. That’s true around the world: it’s true in Iceland, Gibraltar, Israel — small countries with high vaccination rates have seen big spikes in COVID cases — and it’s every bit as true here in the United States. According to the CDC today, fully three-quarters of the people infected in a recent outbreak, for example, in Massachusetts had already been vaccinated. The CDC announced vaccinated people can carry the virus with them, and they can easily spread the virus to others. As the CDC conceded, ""Breakthrough infections may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases."" Ok. So now we learn that virtually everything they told us about the COVID vaccine was wrong. Looks like we were right to ask questions. Keep in mind that if you’d written any of what we just said on Facebook yesterday, you would have been censored immediately for misinformation, if not for a hate crime. Yet now, it’s the official finding of the U.S. government. Surprised? You shouldn’t be surprised. Science is like that. It can change quickly. It is never really settled, despite what they tell you. If the Biden administration had just admitted that from the beginning, we’d be better off now. Most Americans understand that medicine is complicated. Even great medicines, chemotherapy, for example, don’t always work. And you don’t know when they’re not going to work, because there’s a lot you don’t know. Most people can live with honest uncertainty. They can handle the truth. What they can’t handle is being lied to relentlessly by their leaders and then shamed if they ask questions.  That’s exactly what’s been happening. You remember just a few weeks ago — July 8 — that Tony Fauci himself was asked directly by a reporter whether the vaccine would work against the new delta variant of COVID. The honest answer would have been, ""we’re not sure,"" or ""we hope it does."" But Fauci is a liar, so that’s not what he said. Instead, as usual, he pretended to know what he doesn’t know and could not know. ""The answer,"" Fauci replied, ""is yes, it does."" Fauci said that on the record, and he said it more or than once. They all said it. Again, and again, and again. And they shouted at you if you asked a follow-up question. You’d think they would be apologizing now, or at least explaining how they got it so completely wrong. But they’re not doing that. That would require humility. It might force them, perhaps, to relinquish some of the immense power they have gathered over the last 18 months. No chance. What they’re doing instead is blaming you for the whole thing. They’re punishing the country for the disaster they made. It’s your fault. The White House announced a new round of crushing lockdowns may be on the way: PETER DOOCY: If scientists come to you at some point down the line and say it is our opinion that there should be shutdowns and there should be school closures, you would do that? KARINE JEAN PIERRE:  Well we listen to - like I said, we listen to the CDC and the expert and their guidance are, you know, the CDC is a body that is very well respected. And we follow again, we follow their guidance. Joe Biden, leaving in a helicopter from the White House lawn said the same thing. ""Yup, new lockdowns could be coming.""COVID 'hypocrite' Nancy Pelosi already breaks her own policyVideo""The CDC is a body that is well-respected,"" mutters the flack, as if repetition makes it true. Respected by whom? How many times do you have to get it wrong before people stop respecting you or believing? Is there any limit on that? And while we’re at it, why are lockdowns the obvious response to a failing vaccine? Who thought that up? What’s the justification for it? Doesn’t seem to be much. Look at the data from the U.K. -- a country that has vaccination rates similar to ours.  In Britain, authorities saw a big spike in cases of the so-called ""delta variant"" a month ago. But the British government didn't reinstitute lockdowns. They didn't force a new mask mandate. What happened next? COVID cases and deaths in the U.K. plummeted.  So the question is: why does the U.S. need more lockdowns? Why the forced masking? Masks are of limited medical value, as the authorities once told us. They clearly hurt kids. They obviously damage society. You can’t breathe when you wear one. Yet the Biden administration is now requiring masks. The surgeon general even demanded that vaccinated people wear masks outside: MSNBC DR. VIVEK MURTHY, US SURGEON GENERAL: If you happen to have a lot of interaction with folks who are unvaccinated, let's say you’re a parent like me who has young children at home who are not vaccinated, that’s a circumstance where we’re being extra cautious and wearing that mask even if you’re fully vaccinated, wearing it outside, when you’re in indoor public locations, is an extra step to protecting those at home.We’re not even going to repeat for you for the third right in a row the actual data on the question of COVID and young people. Are your small children at risk of dying from COVID? No. Not unless they have a profoundly dangerous preexisting condition like Leukemia. In which case, beware. Otherwise, they’ll be fine. That’s what the numbers say.And yet, there’s the Surgeon General, whatever that is, telling you to wear a mask outside with your kids. This is crazy. Let’s just say it out loud. Even the people enforcing the rules, demanding that you change your life, that you put your life on hold, don’t actually believe the rules they’re imposing on you. Nancy Pelosi just called for the arrest of anyone who doesn't wear a mask in the Capitol, yet she just asked to take off masks to wear a photo. PELOSI: Can we take off our masks just for the photo? Would that be allowed? (all masks comes off)Oh, so when masks are inconvenient for you, you get to take them off. Like when you’re flying in a private plane to Washington or when you want a picture that shows your face. But anyone else that takes them off gets arrested. And they’re doubling down and tripling down. Congressional Democrats are now calling for a vaccinate mandate in Congress. That means everyone in the building — members and staffers — would be required to get a shot the CDC told us today apparently doesn’t work very well, and by the way, whose long-term effects can’t be known. But they’re telling you they must get it. You must get it. Your kids must get it in order to return to school. The question is really: How long are Americans going to put up with this? What happens when large groups of people start to resist these mandates, as inevitably they will, because they’re too unreasonable, too irrational, and not rooted in science? They’re pushing us toward something awful. Maybe that’s the point of threatening to arrest people who won’t wear masks at the Capitol. Once they’ve done that, what will they do next, call out the National Guard?That’d be fine with the media, apparently. Journalists are doing everything they can to convince you that emergency measures are necessary -- civil rights should be suspended, in the case of COVID. They're even lying to make that point. In Kansas City, for example, NBC affiliate KSHB posted a disturbing report this week.  ""Children's Mercy Hospital is operating to capacity, not only because of COVID-19 cases among youths who aren't eligible to be vaccinated, but also due to ending mask policies."" That was a report.Oh, wow, really? When you get rid of mask policies and you don’t make 3-year-olds get the vaccine, your hospitals fill up and millions die. The ICUs are flooded again -- all because of children and people who aren't wearing their masks because they believe in QAnon or they’re racist. That’s what they’re telling you. And not just in Kansas City, everywhere. But is it true? In this case, it’s not. Children's Mercy Hospital said it had no idea what the local news media was talking about. Tucker Carlson: Coronavirus lockdowns had 'greater costs than we ever imagined' Video""We continue to be able to meet the needs of our patients requiring hospitalization,"" Children's Mercy wrote in a statement. ""The increase in children we are treating as in-patients is mainly due to respiratory illnesses"" -- ones that are unrelated to COVID. In other words, no, in Kansas City, the hospitals are not flooded with QAnon believers who refuse to wear their masks. They lied about that. Why would they be lying about that? What is all of this about? At the very moment we discovered they had been telling us something that was not true about the CDC, they redouble their efforts to make you believe what all of us know is false. This is what one ""vaccine expert"" at the University of Maryland -- Kathleen Nuezil -- spelled it out. Here's what she just told The Washington Post.  ""We really need to shift toward a goal of preventing serious disease and disability and medical consequences, and not worry about every virus detected in somebody’s nose,"" Neuzil said. ""It’s hard to do, but I think we have to become comfortable with coronavirus not going away."" ""We have to become comfortable with the coronavirus not going away."" What does that mean exactly?"																
7	0	I Am A Living Proof That COVID-19 Is Fake This is my unfiltered take of why I think the COVID-19 virus is fake or it doesn’t exist. Since March 11, 2020 until now in October 13, 2021 at the time of this writing: I’m still living like it’s still 2019 (pre-pandemic) I haven’t been social distancing at all I only wear a face mask if someone forces me Other than that I go inside buildings not wearing a mask! XD I’m not vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine and not planning to Yet I did not infect anybody I’m barely sick If this was a killer virus I would have died long time ago I observed that wearing a face mask is pointless, because the positive cases are still surging. I observed that getting vaccinated is unnecessary, because the positive cases are still surging. Even with all the scare related to COVID-19 still going on, at the end of the day, we can still go back to our soft cushy beds and relax the night away. If you think really hard about it; it’s kind of sus: A virus that came from a bat or a snake in some wet market in Wuhan, China Some Chinese person ate the single snake that has COVID-19 virus Then it somehow spread all over the world Then it somehow mutated into an assortment of variants Specifically the economy & small businesses had to be shut down and specifically Capitalism dismantled all because of a virus that came from a little snake. Wow! The COVID-19 virus must be VERY powerful! XD Some say the COVID-19 virus is a bioweapon. XD Yeah, like getting a runny nose and loss of taste is a result of a bioweapon. XD I observed that the COVID-19 virus is no worse than a seasonal flu. COVID-19 cases increased while seasonal flu cases plummeted. XD People who would bash me in this post would say: “Lots of people are dying from COVID!” Well lots of people are dying anyway from random stuff year after year after year. Anthony Fauci would hibernate in the summer when the weather is warm & full of Vitamin D and emerge again in the winter on the TV when everybody is getting sick from the flu. This whole COVID-19 thing reminds me of the children’s story the Emperor’s New Clothes: The emperor thought that he was wearing a beautiful robe He would prance around in public with his ‘beautiful robe’ But in actuality, the emperor is actually naked. Moral Lesson of this story: The government and media had the masses be-LIE-ving that we are on a war with germs. But like the emperor’s fictional robe this COVID-19 virus doesn’t exist at all. Despite massive numbers of exorbitant cases & death figures, the doctors and specialists have not yet proven the COVID-19 virus exists. The COVID-19 virus was not isolated or identified and other possible causes of the illness were barely considered. For me this entire COVID-19 pandemic is nothing but a sleight of hand. This entire COVID-19 pandemic is just all about control & economic destruction. To dismantle the current capitalist system in favor of a greater centralized technocrat rule. I have plenty more to say about the COVID hoax but they are separate posts and separate categories by itself. I like to keep this short and sweet.																
8	0	I have a PhD in virology and immunology. I’m a clinical lab scientist and have tested 1500 “supposed” positive Covid 19 samples collected here in S. California. When my lab team and I did the testing through Koch’s postulates and observation under a SEM (scanning electron microscope), we found NO Covid in any of the 1500 samples.What we found was that all of the 1500 samples were mostly Influenza A and some were influenza B, but not a single case of Covid, and we did not use the B.S. PCR test.We then sent the remainder of the samples to Stanford, Cornell, and a few of the University of California labs and they found the same results as we did, NO COVID. They found influenza A and B. All of us then spoke to the CDC and asked for viable samples of COVID, which CDC said they could not provide as they did not have any samples. We have now come to the firm conclusion through all our research and lab work, that the COVID 19 was imaginary and fictitious.The flu was called Covid and most of the 225,000 dead were dead through co-morbidities such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, emphysema etc. and they then got the flu which further weakened their immune system and they died.I have yet to find a single viable sample of Covid 19 to work with. We at the 7 universities that did the lab tests on these 1500 samples are now suing the CDC for Covid 19 fraud. the CDC has yet to send us a single viable, isolated and purifed sample of Covid 19. If they can’t or won’t send us a viable sample,I say there is no Covid 19, it is fictitious. The four research papers that do describe the genomic extracts of the Covid 19 virus never were successful in isolating and purifying the samples. All the four papers written on Covid 19 only describe small bits of RNA which were only 37 to 40 base pairs long which is NOT A VIRUS. A viral genome is typically 30,000 to 40,000 base pairs.With as bad as Covid is supposed to be all over the place, how come no one in any lab world wide has ever isolated and purified this virus in its entirety? That’s because they’ve never really found the virus, all they’ve ever found was small pieces of RNA which were never identified as the virus anyway.So what we’re dealing with is just another flu strain like every year, COVID 19 does not exist and is fictitious. I believe China and the globalists orchestrated this COVID hoax (the flu disguised as a novel virus) to bring in global tyranny and a worldwide police totalitarian surveillance state, and this plot included massive election fraud to overthrow Trump.																
9	0	How do you convince the world’s population to take an unproven, extremely dangerous and potentially deadly vaccine (with a purported success rate ranging from 70% to 94.7%) to immunize against Covid-19, a version of the corona virus (the ubiquitous common cold), when 80% of the world’s population is naturally immune and 99.997% of all patients who supposedly get Covid-19 survive?You tell a Great Lie. A whopper! A generation-altering doozy.Let’s examine, much like a forensic examiner would, the key components of the Great Lie of the COVID-19 second wave. The anatomy of a Great Lie is predictably a series of big lies woven together into a deadly cloak of deception.Lie No. 1: COVID-19 is a terrible plague — one of the worst global pandemics ever.Data now reveals that the so-called horrible Covid-19 pandemic was nothing more than a moderate cold/flu season. The novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) had remarkable survivability, despite the mass media gaslighting hysteria surrounding it.Dr. Roger Hodkinson, chairman of the Canadian Royal College of Physicians observed: “There is utterly unfounded public hysteria driven by the media and politicians. This the biggest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public. There is absolutely nothing that can be done to contain this virus. This is nothing more than a bad flu season. It’s politics playing medicine and that’s a very dangerous game.”Read “Top Canadian Pathologist On COVID: ‘Greatest Hoax Ever Perpetrated'”Lie No. 2: Covid-19 killed so many patients.According to researcher Justin Heart: “Bombshell assertion by Johns Hopkins Economic and Statistics Experts. ‘These data suggest that in contrast to most people’s assumptions, the number of deaths by COVID-19 is not alarming. In fact, it has relatively no effect on deaths in the United States.’“It is acknowledged by experts both within allopathic medicine and by independent investigators that Covid-19 alone does not kill many patients. As the chart above reveals, anyone reasonably healthy under the age of 70 will survive the novel corona virus.What does kill patients is the malady they were already dying from, known as a comorbidity. Every precaution is taken to help dying patients avoid catching a cold or flu, as that is known to hasten their demise.In October 2020, the CDC quietly amended its statistics to credit the real cause of death in all Covid-19 cases was NOT COVID-19.Lie No. 3: There is a Covid-19 second wave.There is no Covid-19 second wave. Nine months of fear and anxiety over a bad chest cold turned into the global nano-terrorist, coupled with the intentional collapse of the middle class global economy, have weakened the immune systems of most of the people around the world. The New Normal and The Great Reset are intended to destroy your health and your life.Leaders in government and medicine know wearing masks damages the body, weakens the immune system and causes ill health. That is why there is an authoritarian surge to enforce mask wearing.There is now the classic increase in cold/flu cases predicted in Chinese Medicine because of seasonal weather change. Gullible flu shot patients are getting sick from the very shot they were told would help them, because of their weakened immune function. Those are the real causes of the lie of the second Covid-19 wave.  Dr. Michael Yeadon, a former chief science officer for the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer says, “There is no science to suggest a second wave should happen.” The Big Pharma insider asserts that false-positive results from inherently unreliable Covid tests are being used to manufacture a “second wave” based on “new cases.”Read “Former Pfizer Science Officer Reveals Great COVID-19 Scam”Lie No. 4: Covid-19 testing reveals so many new cases.The increase in nasal swab testing is delivering in excess of 70% false positives, according to follow-up analyses.“All Covid-19 tests are a scam,” according to Dr. Judy A. Mikovits, author of the The New York Times No. 1 Best Seller “Plague of Corruption.”“The PCR test is especially worthless.”Quite literally, the PCR test is a research tool, not a diagnostic aid. Check out the following Nov. 17 Winter Watch article for complete details.Read “Wildly Inaccurate PCR Testing Puts the Scam in the COVID-19 Scamdemic”Lie No. 5: Masks are necessary to stop the spread of Covid-19.“Masks are utterly useless,” Hodkinson noted. “There is no evidence whatsoever they are effective. It is utterly ridiculous seeing these unfortunate, uneducated people walking around like lemmings obeying without any evidence. Social distancing is also useless. Positive testing results do NOT indicate clinical infection.”Read “Maker of COVID Tests Says Pandemic is Biggest Hoax Ever Perpetrated”According to Dr. Colleen Huber, NMD, “Masks make you sick, masks weaken your immune system. Masks ultimately kill you. Did you know more people died from masks causing bacterial pneumonia than from the Spanish flu 100 years ago?”Read “Health risks of face masks in the corona crisis – Dr. Colleen Huber”Lie No. 6: The 2020 flu shot helps you in the fight against Covid-19.The latest flu shot is intended to make you sick, not prevent the flu. It is meant to run up the Covid-19 numbers, create more demand for the rushed-to-market vaccines.“The flu shot is the key, it triggers SARS-CoV-2,” Mikovits explained. “I have been begging people not to get a flu shot — especially this year — it is designed to make you sick and support the Covid-19 scamdemic.”Lie No. 7: All illness is now Covid-19 related. Big Pharma has gone beyond propaganda. They are now gaslighting the exploitable, fear-addled public. Criminal deceivers in government, mass media and corporate medicine constantly bray about the insane worldwide plague that isn’t.A large new study, led by a team of geneticists from University College London and published in the peer-reviewed journal “Nature Communications,” has investigated over 10,000 mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and concluded there currently does not appear to be any variant that is more infectious or transmissible.Read “No evidence coronavirus has mutated to become more infectious”The truth to counter The Great Lie: There is no second wave of Covid-19. The truth is we are entering another typical cold/flu season and face the chilling probability of widespread, permanent injuries as well as millions of deaths from a vaccine seeking to rewrite your very DNA to combat a disease with a 99.997% survival rate for anyone under the age of 70. Avoid the Covid-19 vaccine as if your life depended on it … for it does.																
10	0	Take 15 minutes and listen to this interview with a hospital nurse — She says that what are called “breakthrough cases” and Delta variant cases are affecting mainly the vaccinated and are in fact adverse reactions to the vaccinations.  She says hospitals and hospital doctors will not acknowledge the fact of adverse reactions and report adverse reactions to the vaccine as new Covid cases.  The more Covid cases and Covid deaths, the more money the hospital makes, so reporting adverse vaccine reactions as new Covid cases is the way hospitals are maximizing their profits.  Obviously, a hospital doctor who disagrees is out of a job.  In other words, the truth about Covid and the vaccine is too costly to the hospital to be acknowledged.The interviewed nurse says that half of the nurses at the hospital where she works are about to lose their jobs, because they refuse to be vaccinated.  We have seen, she says, the terrible effects of vaccination on patients and are unwilling to do this to ourselves. Many nurses want to quit regardless, because they cannot stop doctors from making people ill by vaccinating them. Medicine, it seems, has ceased to be about health.This hospital’s policy is essentially the policy of all the hospitals.  It suits NIH, CDC, and FDA, because it protects the vaccine’s reputation and that of the regulators who approved its emergency use, and it protects Big Pharma’s profits, some of which flow back to the regulators.As Stew Peters sums up the interview, it is murder for money.The nurse says that the only treatment the hospital gives Covid patients is Remdesivir and puts patients on ventilators.  Remdesivir has serious adverse effects of its own, and ventilators are a known killer of Covid patients.Asked about Ivermectin, hospitals refuse to use it even if a doctor prescribes it for a patient.  As I reported, at another hospital a wife had to get a court order that the hospital had to give the dying husband treatment with Ivermectin.  But the hospital dragged its feet, and apparently Big Pharma got to the judge and he withdrew his order.  The patient has likely been murdered by the refusal of treatment with Ivermectin. For hospitals, it is Big Pharma protocol over life.Contrast this with the successful widespread use of Ivermectin in India to control Covid, and the decision by the Tokyo Medical Association to recommend that all doctors treat Covid patients with Ivermectin. The conclusion is that when it comes to Covid treatment, the American medical system is the most backward one in the world.Unfortunately, the presstitutes will not report any of this, and unfortunately most Americans are too busy wasting their time in the ways they do to save their lives by watching a 15 minute interview.The Covid lie began with the PCR test run at high cycles that made the test unreliable and a generator of a high rate of false positives.  This is how the “pandemic” was created.  Millions of people who did not have Covid were reported as having Covid because of the false positives generated by the PCR test.  This intentional lie was used to create the fear that drove people to be guinea pigs for a dangerous experimental “vaccine.”Fear was also driven by financial incentives given to hospitals. Covid deaths meant bonus payments.  This cleverness gave hospitals incentives to report all possible deaths as Covid deaths.  The flu season, heart attacks, cancer, pneumonia, all became Covid deaths.  The greatly exaggerated figure was used to heighten the fear factor.In truth the people dying were people with Covid and co-morbidities, and they were dying because they were not being treated except with ventilators, which turned out not to be a treatment that addresses Covid.native advertisingKnown and safe treatments were withheld, because otherwise emergency use could not be granted the pending vaccines.  Emergency use authorization is dependent on the absence of treatments that cure.  This is why in the US and Europe HCQ and Ivermectin, both long approved, long in use, and so safe that they are available for over-the-counter purchase in most of the world, were demonized as “dangerous,” “unapproved,” and it is why false stories financed by Big Pharma are spread, such as this one — which convince people that there is no alternative to the “vaccine.”The vaccine is not a vaccine.  It is an effort to substitute experimental RNA technology for a vaccine, and it has failed big time.  What was yesterday “fully vaccinated” is today unvaccinated.  A booster shot is needed, and Fauci now says one will be needed every 8 months or despite numerous shots you will be unvaccinated.  In Israel where 84% are “vaccinated,” the pandemic among the vaccinated is so great that the Israeli health czar already has Israelis on a second booster. It seems humanity is to become a pin cushion for vaccine needles.The so-called vaccine not only fails to protect, it produces serious and deadly adverse effects.  Indeed, the likely case is that the great majority of what are said to be new Covid cases are in fact adverse reactions to the vaccine.  This would explain why the great majority of what are labeled new Covid cases are among the “fully vaccinated” and why new cases rise with vaccination.  See the Israeli table for example—If already there are variants, it is highly likely that they are results of the vaccine which top rank scientists believe enables the virus to escape immune response.  In other words, the more vaccination, the more variants, the more Covid spreads.It would be impossible to design a greater failure or a greater threat to public health and civil liberty than the mRNA vaccines and the campaign behind them.  Many distinguished experts have reached this conclusion and speak it, but they are censored.  Why?  Is it only because they threaten vaccine profits?Despite the massive undeniable total failure of the Covid Vaccine, there is enormous pressure from everywhere for universal vaccination.  Biden wants it mandated by the Labor Department that every firm with 100 employees requires vaccination as a condition of employment. Hospitals and HMOs are requiring it of their doctors and nurses.  Universities are refusing to allow unvaccinated students to even take online courses! There are calls to deny unvaccinated people access to restaurants, hotels, public transportation, sports events, hospitals, and even visits to their own doctor and dentist.  A Covid Passport which has to be updated every 8 months means endless paperwork.  Every time you turn around it is time to get a new passport.The pressure is unrelenting. If you make a purchase from a pharmacy in the state of Georgia, it will be handed to you in a red and white bag reading in giant letters: “I said Yes to the Vaccine to Help End the Pandemic.”  “Covid Vaccine is safe,” declares the bag. “Side effects are mild and last a day or two.”  Now do your part to control the pandemic—Get Vaccinated.  Department of Public Health, Government of Georgia.This from a public health department despite the fact that vaccination  does not protect, requires endless booster shots, and is causing a pandemic of adverse reactions and new variants!The only possible conclusion is that either public officials, employers,  and university administrators are so completely stupid that they cannot fathom the clear evidence or they want more adverse vaccine reactions, more new variants, and more Covid cases.																
11	0	American adults who have not yet received the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine say that they will probably not, or definitely will not, get them. Around 64 percent of unvaccinated Americans have little to no confidence that COVID shots are effective against new variants, including the delta variant that officials say is responsible for the majority of cases in the United States.Some say that if the vaccine rollouts were really a benevolent program that followed science, then there would be no need to force the public to get shots using propaganda – things would naturally take care of themselves and the Americans who have already taken the shots would no longer present a threat to the rest of society.However, that is not the case. The more resistance the government encounters, the more aggressive it becomes in presenting “facts and evidence” about COVID-19. President Joe Biden recently said that the only pandemic happening right now is the “pandemic of the unvaccinated,” despite data showing that vaccinated individuals make up the bulk of infections and hospitalizations.The government also said that vaccines offer more reliable protections compared to natural immunity, but medical studies from around the world showed that natural immunity offers up to 27 times more protection than vaccines.The government also said that vaccines are “safe and effective” despite having no long-term data to prove these claims. Multiple studies have also shown that vaccine effectiveness is questionable at best.Vaccinated individuals represent the majority of new infections and hospitalizations in Israel, which is one of the most vaccinated nations in the world. Study shows that new infections in Israel have surged a few months after the COVID-19 vaccines were introduced.In the U.S., the outbreaks in 2020 ended before the vaccine rollout. This means the vaccines had nothing to do with the decrease in infection rates – they dropped on their own. The infection rates went up again as the delta variant emerged in the midst of the mass vaccination campaign.Health expert: vaccine mandate not supported by scienceThe public has grown weary of the forced vaccinations set up by the government, which is evident in mass walkouts and sickouts, as well as other protests against mandates for companies with over 100 employees.There are also refusals from armed forces across all branches, as well as city police forces. Most employers and government offices can barely function as it is. There is little chance that they can cope with the loss of the workforce. (Related: Survey: Most Americans oppose vaccination mandates.)Dr. Marty Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said that mandating vaccines for everyone is not well-supported by science. He also has concerns about the two-dose regimen for younger people.Makary pointed out that the government does not see a similar health fervor for people who smoke, drink alcohol or refuse to wear a helmet when riding a bike. Around 85,000 Americans die from alcohol every year, but there are few compulsory requirements to cut these deaths.The notion that the government has to vaccinate every American, up to every newborn to control the pandemic is based on the false assumption that the risk of dying from COVID is equally distributed in the population. But the young and healthy are rarely affected by the virus.Requiring the vaccine in people who already have natural immunity also has no scientific basis. A Cleveland Clinic study found that vaccinating people with natural immunity did not add to their level of protection.																
12	0	It is quite clear to me that, whatever the truth is about the origins of the virus or whether or not it actually exists in the precise form that we’re told, certain things have happened & continue to happen.Very closely together in time, scores of countries simultaneously discarded their pandemic preparedness plans & instead adopted what I’ve dubbed the “Eight covid19 lies”.Here’s a detailed example in an interview given to Highwire some weeks ago: What almost every government told their people was an absurd set of statements, most of them easily disproven by reference to published literature & often simply by thinking.These statements were & remain untrue, every last one of them. When politicians make technical statements, it’s not reasonable to expect them to know whether it’s right or not. But when the advisory team guiding policy responses is invoked, as they usually are, untrue statements by those with good levels of knowledge & experience has no better description than lies. These are not ‘slip-ups’, ‘well-intentioned mistakes’, ‘erring on the side of caution’ or similar. They’re deliberately misleading.In all countries for which I have information, the communications were done with the guidance of people who’s professional jobs are psychological manipulators, sometimes called ‘PsyOps’, and used fear over anything else.Once you examine these statements, you have all the evidence needed to show to a receptive, open minded person that indeed we are all facing a heavily manipulated situation.While I recognise there’s a constant flow of important new information, such as the time ordering of patents, people apparently becoming magnetised after vaccination, the concept of ‘shedding’, graphene oxide in the vaccines etc. I’m more than happy to benefit from others diligence on all these emerging items, and not to invest time I don’t have myself.I’m not convinced that many of the usual institutions are operative, and so I’m not aiming to influence them (in U.K. for example, Parliament).native advertisingI may be wrong to do so, but I’m now aiming solely at the general public. I have given & will continue to give interviews on the theme of the “Eight covid19 lies”.I put it to the list that while interesting, it’s not necessary for the purpose of trying to wake up the public to know & tell them about anything more that proves beyond doubt that there’s massive SV scale fraud & deception going on.There is no possible benign interpretation of the fact that we’re all being lied to, for between 15-18months. None whatsoever. All that has been accomplished is destruction of the economies of many G20 countries, wrecking of civil societies, substantial, avoidable loss of life (often through deprivation of healthcare) and a pervading sense of fear, everywhere.Additionally, large & growing fractions of populations have been injected with new technology, experimental gene based vaccines, which have been associated with rates of death shortly afterwards of 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than any previous public health prophylactic vaccine. Everywhere they are steamrollering appropriate objections to vaccination in people who cannot benefit from this intervention, yet certainly can be harmed or even killed by them.We hear the imminent arrival of ‘vaccine passports’, which don’t enhance public safety yet grant to the state totalitarian tyranny over them.There is no other interpretation that fits all the major facts, than that the goal is control through what will be the world’s first digital identity database.What will be done with that power, we cannot be sure. My views or rather reasoned deductions are well known & I continue to stand by them.There being immunologically no need or justification for 3rd & subsequent vaccines (booster, top-up, variant) the fact that they’re imminently to be administered to people en masse should send alarm bells ringing loudly.Biotechnology has awesome power but it can very easily be misused. I am of the view that 3rd & subsequent vaccines may be used to initiate depopulation. The first generation vaccines I don’t think were deliberately made to be dangerous so they’re no guide at all to what might be next.Bottom line, my intentions are best served by me continuing to give as many interviews as I can, alone or in groups, to those with the largest audiences.This note is in no way intended to be critical. It’s just great that people are stepping forward. But I do believe in this world war, there are no Allies. No one is coming to save us. Time is marching on.I wish us all the most persuasive skills in your efforts to persuade the persuadable. Many aren’t.																
13	0	Covid is a group of symptoms, not a disease, according to one of the world’s leading virus experts, Dr. Judy Mikovitz. When you test “positive” for Covid, you’re really just testing positive for common colds, flu viruses and pathogens from previous vaccines.top 10 biggest lies about covid 19When most people run a high fever, their body is actually fighting off bacteria from the Covid masks they wear all day and the pathogens that were injected with the Covid inoculations.The entire pandemic is based on false pretenses and fabricated statistics, so we must look at the biggest lies that were concocted, like a synthetic virus in a lab, and then spread around with propaganda, like a TV “breaking news” pandemic update.Anyone wearing a mask who got a flu shot this summer is literally growing the pandemic because they will be sick and test “positive” for Covid, and also be convinced they had Covid.Then when they quarantine, social distance and continue to mask up, they will be weakening themselves while exacerbating whatever cold or flu they have even more so.Therefore, the vaccines start the wave of sickness, the PCR tests show almost everyone positive for vaccine-induced sickness, and the masks and lockdowns fuel the viruses and bacteria even more.It’s a vicious cycle and everyone thinks we’re in the middle of a worldwide pandemic caused by a virus, when it’s really caused by the Covid vaccines and promoted by false-positive PCR testing.Which Of These TEN Most Popular Covid Lies Do You Still Believe?LIE #1. Covid is still contagious when you’re asymptomatic.LIE #2. PCR tests tell you whether or not you have or had Covid-19 (or Delta).LIE #3. Vaccines usually prevent you from catching Covid, or make it a mild case if you do.LIE #4. Covid-19 vaccines help with immunity against variants, like Delta and Lambda.LIE #5. A lab can test for Covid-19 and prove in court if you had it (like forensic DNA).LIE #6. Covid vaccines are safe, even for pregnant women.LIE #7. Vaccine immunity is stronger than natural immunity.LIE #8. Without vaccines, you’re at high risk of catching and dying from Covid.LIE #9. Vaccines provide better immunity for Covid than vitamin D, zinc and Ivermectin.LIE #10. Masks, social distancing and lockdowns have helped “flatten the curve.”The 160 Million Americans Who Got Covid Vaccinated Have A New Inflammatory Disease Driving Their “Pre-Existing” Inflammatory DiseasesMost Americans who got the Covid jabs already are the ones who are terrified of the virus because they already have compromised immune systems, whether from obesity, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, COPD or just chronic inflammation from poor eating and toxic medicine, including vaccines.The spike-protein injections (Covid shots) are creating trillions of miniscule clogs in the blood, causing the heart to become inflamed and overworked, driving other diseases to the tipping point (needed hospitalization or death). Healthy people can fix this “pandemic” by NOT getting any vaccines and NOT wearing a mask, as Dr. Mikovitz has explained.Scholars, doctors, scientists and immunologists are stepping up and blowing the whistle on the “plandemic” and exposing the fake shots, the fake tests that almost always read positive, and the fake “safety protocols” that are being shoved down our throats by big and small government alike, plus by corporations, school systems and most of all, the medical industrial complex.																
14	0	Dr. Astrid Stückelberger dropped some major bombshells during a recent interview that completely blew the lid on billionaire eugenicist Bill Gates, the corrupt World Health Organization (WHO), and other nefarious elements that all conspired together to perpetrate the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) plandemic on the world.A scientist, writer and WHO insider, Dr. Stückelberger used to believe in the work of the United Nations arm until she started to see some serious red flags with the way it operates. Much like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the WHO functions more like a private corporation than it does a public health agency, working to advance the interests of Big Pharma and other pro-vaccine forces like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.As a professor at the University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland as well as a lecturer within the Institute of Global Health of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Geneva, Dr. Stückelberger is a credible source, by the way, whose insider information about the WHO is noteworthy.In a nutshell, WHO member states, of which there 193, are bound by whatever rules and restrictions the WHO decides to impose in the name of “public health.” With the Chinese virus, the WHO pronounced all sorts of new requirements that the vast majority went along with, except for two: Iran and the United States under President Donald Trump.Behind the scenes, Gates and his cohorts, along with GAVI, were steering the WuFlu ship with the WHO appearing to make all the decisions. And thanks to the way the WHO operates, the plandemic was easy to implement.“It is embedded in the constitution of the WHO,” says Dr. Stückelberger about the ease with which the WHO is able to decree international ‘health regulations.’ “So, they don’t need to adopt it. It is immediately approved and it’s an obligation, so it is legally binding.”You can watch the full interview with Dr. Stückelberger below:Bill Gates petitioned to become his own “member state” at the WHOGates holds an incredible amount of sway over decisions made at the WHO, which impact most countries around the world. He has paid the agency so much money over the years that he now thinks he has the right to vote as if he was his own country.Dr. Stückelberger explains that Gates holds immunity in Switzerland where such deals are made, as does GAVI, and has repeatedly tried to become his own “member state” in the eyes of the WHO – though it is unclear if he was ever actually voted in as such.Even so, Gates still pulls a lot of strings at the WHO. He negotiates and signs contracts on behalf of different countries, acting as the unelected middle man in deciding which vaccines or pharmaceuticals will be purchased by them.As you may recall, Gates planned for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) with his Event 201 exercise back in the fall of 2019. This exercise involved strategizing for a major pandemic that just so happened to materialize several months later.Dr. Stückelberger witnessed firsthand how the WHO has been holding the same types of exercises for years, which is what first tipped her off to something fishy. She also notes that in recent years, the WHO has changed all sorts of definitions in its health guidelines to allow for any form of influenza or even the common cold to potentially be declared a “pandemic.”Even the word “immunity,” she says, which we likewise noted, has been redefined by the WHO to only include vaccine-related “immunity” as opposed to natural immunity.																
15	0	“American Journal” host Harrison Smith branded Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdowns as “flawed” two years after they were first implemented. He also took umbrage at how COVID-19 deaths were counted.Smith quoted an article by the Daily Mail criticizing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests used to identify COVID-19. The March 12 piece puts forward the possibility of the test itself and the lockdowns put in place being problematic. “The gold standard PCR tests … were picking up people who weren’t actually infected. Some even suggested that the swabs, which have been carried out more than 200 million times in the U.K. alone, may mistake common colds and flu for [the coronavirus.]”It added: “If either or both were true, it would mean that many of the cases should never have been counted in the daily tally. [The] ominous and all-too-familiar figure, which is used to inform decision on [lockdowns] and other pandemic measures, was an over-count.” (Related: SCIENCE FAIL: Portuguese court rules PCR tests are unreliable, unlawful “evidence” of alleged Covid-19 infections.)The “American Journal” host did not hold back on his response to the British tabloid.“Let me go ahead and answer that question for you, Daily Mail. Yes, they were flawed; they picked up the flu and the cold as COVID-19; and they detected dead COVID-19 strains up to 12 weeks after the person had been infected. It was all a lie, [and] people doing this knew that they were doing it. They imposed lockdowns and restrictions, and destroyed the economy based on these flawed assumptions that they knew were flawed from the very beginning,” Smith said.“They locked down your country on purpose. They killed hundreds of thousands of people by denying them things like ivermectin – [despite] the fact that there were cures for this disease a month into the pandemic. The lockdowns … just destroyed economies, leading to the death of millions.COVID-19 deaths inflated to maintain the big lieSmith also voiced out his criticism of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) for supposedly “redefining” what constitutes a COVID-19 death. The move by the Bay State’s health department will reduce the state’s death tally by the thousands, according to the Lowell Sun.DPH State Epidemiologist Dr. Catherine Brown said of the move: “We believe that this will provide us a much more accurate picture of who has died [in association with] a COVID-19 infection in Massachusetts, and it will also improve our ability to compare our data with data from other jurisdictions. We think this is an absolutely critical step in improving our understanding of who COVID-19 has impacted most significantly during the pandemic.”Smith remarked: “Under the old guidance – if the virus appeared as the cause of death on someone’s death certificate or if they tested positive for the virus [within] 60 days of death, it’s counted in the statewide [COVID-19] death tally. They’re just lying to pump up the numbers, to justify the lockdowns [and] to destroy [the] economy [and the] supply chain.”According to the “American Journal” host, there must be a “massive worldwide reckoning” in which all those responsible for destroying Americans’ lives in the name of public health must “be held to account.” He added: “The only way possible that we can get back to some sense of normalcy is if the people who led us down this path, who lied to us day in and day out and destroyed our country, get what’s coming to them.”But Smith is not exactly optimistic about the prospect of the medical tyrants being held to account over their actions.“It’ll never happen because the American people have just been castrated. [They’ve] been there just stomping on our nuts, and we sit here and allow them to do it – and [even] thank them for the opportunity.”Head over to MedicalFascism.news for more related stories.																
16	0	Even though the media is now consumed with covering the Russia-Ukraine conflict, we cannot let it get memory-holed that Tony Fauci, Rochelle Walensky, Donald Trump, Francis Collins and many others lied about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) “vaccines.”For more than a year, all of these people told the world that Fauci Flu shots are “safe and effective” even though tens of millions of people who got them are now injured or dead.“The fact that people like Rochelle Walensky, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins said ‘safe and effective’ – this [should result in] criminal charges,” said Dr. Naomi Wolf during a recent appearance with Steve Bannon on his “War Room: Pandemic” program.Wolf does not want the world to forget that career criminals like Walensky conspired to commit crimes against humanity with the mass injection program, which still continues to this day.The primary targets now are young children, though many are starting to rise up against this. The world is realizing that these shots are deadly and not even needed in the first place, but that does not mean that we should let those who pushed them on us all get away with it.Everyone who pushed COVID vaccines deserves to be prosecuted for their crimes against humanityIn a recent statement, Walensky tried to pretend as though “waning” immunity from the jabs was never properly communicated to people like herself, which she says is why she pushed the shots so hard.“So many of us wanted to be helpful,” she said.“So many of us wanted to say, ‘Okay, this is our ticket out, right? Now we’re done.’ So, I think we have perhaps too little caution and too much optimism for some good things that came our way. I really do. I think all of us wanted this to be done.”Walensky was reportedly tapped to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Dec. 8, 2020. She was quickly installed upon Joe Biden’s “inauguration,” and she, Fauci, Collins, and many others got to work in executing the next phases of Trump’s Operation Warp Speed program.“Vaccination is a critical tool in bringing this unprecedented pandemic to an end,” stated Robert Redfield, Walensky’s predecessor, just before leaving office. Redfield, of course, served under Trump.“We know for sure that the vaccine is highly efficacious in preventing the clinical disease,” added Fauci in a similar statement to CNBC around the very same time.Even long after leaving office, Trump himself has continued to promote the jabs. We also now know that he was directly involved in the global racketeering and collusion scheme to spread the jabs all around the world at warp speed.To this very day, all of these people are recommending COVID injections, including for young children.Walensky, in another recent statement, said that she might even recommend a second “booster” shot for both children and adults depending on what her overlords instruct her to do.“I have frequently said, ‘We’re going to lead with the science; the science is going to be the foundation of everything we do.’ That is entirely true,” Walensky lied.“I think the public heard that science is foolproof, science is black and white, science is immediate, and we get the answer and then we make the decision based on the answer. And the truth is science is gray, and science is not always immediate, and sometimes it takes months and years to actually find out the answer. But you have to make decisions in a pandemic before you have that answer.”																
17	0	An emergency physician by the name of Dr. Joseph Fraiman is speaking out about the fact that just like many others in his field, he was deceived by the prevailing plandemic narrative.Early on, Fraiman said during a recent Zoom call with proponents of the Great Barrington Declaration, it seemed like everyone just fell in line with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) fearmongering because of all the rhetoric about “saving lives.”The world was told that staying locked down and masked at all times – and later getting “vaccinated” – were the only ways to get out of the crisis. Fraiman believed all that at the time. But his views have since changed.“These policies were harmful,” Fraiman said. You can watch a clip of him speaking below:Dr. Joseph Fraiman: “Personally, I would like to apologize to the three other scientists sitting with me here on Zoom, the proponents of the Great Barrington Declaration…I’m sorry, because I believe now you guys were correct. And you were correct from the beginning.” pic.twitter.com/a7AbdU5zRw— Michael P Senger (@MichaelPSenger) March 7, 2022“Initially, it was irrelevant because there were lives on the line. I’m an emergency doctor – there are lives, we have to do it. But if the policies didn’t really make a difference and only caused harm, then you really have to start rethinking what you’re doing,” Fraiman said.Is it enough just to apologize?Seeing the damage that was caused by these policies, Fraiman wants Americans and really everyone to think long and hard about whether or not we ever want to do something like this again in the event that another alleged pathogen emerges.“I think as a society we have to decide if we want to continue a public policy that is obviously producing large harm,” Fraiman said.“Also, personally, I would like to apologize to the three other scientists sitting with me here on Zoom, the proponents of the Barrington Declaration, because initially I did think you all were crazy, or dumb, or maybe you just didn’t understand what I was seeing. But I now realize, actually – I’m sorry, because I believe now that you guys are correct, and you were correct from the beginning.”Fraiman said he wishes that more people, including himself, have figured it all out sooner. But better late than never.“And I hope more people realize that soon enough,” he added.The Great Barrington Declaration contains the signatures of many prominent doctors and other medical professionals, as well as scientists and researchers whose careers center around helping people.Co-authored by Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a professor and epidemiologist at Harvard University, and Dr. Sunetra Gupta, also a professor and epidemiologist from the University of Oxford, the document calls for all lockdowns to end.Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a professor and epidemiologist from Stanford University, is also a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration.“Everyone who told us the ‘vaccine’ was ‘safe and effective’ needs to be indicted and tried in a court of law,” wrote someone in response to the video of Fraiman speaking. “Plainly, we were lied to, and all those who refused the jab and lost their jobs as a result should be re-instated with full pay.”Another person suggested that Fraiman might just be trying to save himself from execution now that the truth is coming out.“They cannot get a pass on this,” said someone else. “It is their job to research and do no harm.”“How convenient,” wrote another. “Let’s be honest: you were looking out for yourself. You weren’t going to risk losing your license. So you knowingly administered a jab you knew had significant question marks. That is criminal.”																
18	0	The husband of an Oregon woman who died last year from a blood clotting disorder just two weeks after getting “vaccinated” with Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J) Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) injection is speaking out about his wife’s “rare” experience.It turns out that what Stan Thomas’ other half suffered is not so rare after all. He explained to NBC News that even if the risk is considered “small” by the government’s standards, it is happening more often than people think.Thousands of similar blood clotting disorders resulting in death have been reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and yet NBC maintains that there is only “a 1-in-a-million risk.”“When it’s eight million doses and two people are going to die from it, who thinks it’s going to be you?” Thomas asked hypothetically in an interview.Monika Melkonian, 52, we now know, received her J&J shot at an injection clinic on April 7, 2021, the same day that both the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) temporarily “paused” that brand of injection due to a flood of reports about vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).“VITT is a sometimes fatal condition characterized by simultaneous acute thrombosis and thrombocytopenia that presents after receiving a COVID vaccine,” explains The Defender (Children’s Health Defense) about the condition.Initially, Melkonian developed a persistent headache and pain behind her left eye. She did not think too much of it and continued to carry out normal daily activities with her husband.By April 17, Melkonian’s headache was mostly gone, so she assumed she was in the clear. But by 4 a.m. the next day (April 18), Thomas says he heard his wife hit the floor, which turned out to be a seizure that caused her to no longer be able to move her right arm.Suspecting a stroke, Thomas called 9-1-1 and had first responders take her to the emergency room. She perished not long after arriving there.“The progression of this was just lightning-fast,” Thomas recalled about how he tried to communicate with his wife by asking her to squeeze his hand once for “yes” and twice for “no” in response to questions.“The last thing that I said to her was that I loved her and asked her to squeeze my hand twice,” he said. “She did.”CDC covid jab task force admits that it excludes certain post-injection heart incidents from data to keep numbers lowOn April 22, 2021, the CDC launched an investigation into Melkonian’s death. Later that year, the agency’s vaccine advisory panel determined that the benefits of getting the shot supposedly outweigh the risks, claiming that only 54 cases of VITT in J&J recipients, nine of which resulted in death, have been reported.“This blood clot was seen in combination with very low platelets,” said the Oregon Health Authority in a follow-up statement following Melkonian’s death.“Prior to the issuance of the pause, cases of this serious blood clot had been identified among six women around the country who received the vaccine.”Concerning the CDC’s declaration that the J&J jab is still safe despite the VITT risk, the agency’s COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force later admitted that certain heart events that occur post-injection are excluded from the data. These include “reports where [the] only thrombosis is ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction.”Doing this, The Defender noted, significantly reduces the number of blood-clotting cases in the official numbers, which in effect makes the injections appear safer than they actually are.The CDC website currently states that most strokes, or around 87 percent, are ischemic strokes, which is when blood flow through the artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked.																
19	0	A few months back, workers transporting vials of a Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccine” drug called CoronaVac suffered serious injuries after a shipment was damaged and spilled.A study on the incident, which took place in Thailand, found that health personnel exposed to the evaporated vial contents suffered ocular surface erosion and skin rashes.“Proximity and timing suggest CoronaVac correlation with the ocular and skin reactions,” the paper’s authors wrote, adding that “we recommend caution during vaccine handling and fastidious clean-up of any spills.”“Cautions should be taken to avoid broken vials, spills, and aerosolization of CoronaVac during the vaccination.”Reading this, one would think that a highly corrosive industrial chemical of some kind was leaked, resulting in serious injuries. But these were supposedly “medicines” that were spilled – medicines that are being injected into people’s bodies.If these drugs cause such health problems on the outside of the body upon exposure, what might they be doing to people’s insides, we wonder?CoronaVac shots contain aluminum hydroxideIt turns out that CoronaVac injections are made in China and contain beta-propiolactone inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral particles (or so they say, since SARS-CoV-2 has never actually been isolated).The jabs have a claimed efficacy rate of just 50.4 percent, and that is the “official” number. In reality, it is likely closer to zero percent efficacy just like for the other injections from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.Concerning CoronaVac specifically, the study looked at a three-day jab campaign that took place at Rajavithi Hospital in Thailand. A total of 20 health personnel worked in the vaccination room of an indoor facility and all received the jab within the first two days.On the third day, a single dose of the vaccine was accidentally dropped on the floor by a nurse, resulting in breakage. She promptly wiped it up with a piece of tissue paper and disposed of it in a trash can where it remained for the rest of the day.That one broken vial caused 15 different personnel to experience skin rashes and ocular surface erosion anywhere from 3-17 hours after the accident. These same 15 people worked in the affected rooms for between 3-6 either during or after the incident occurred while another five who were also there showed no adverse reactions.“All 15 personnel with ocular symptoms had some degree of conjunctivitis including: eye irritation (9); red eyes (7); tearing (7); and swollen eyelids (4),” reported the Daily Exposé.“The nurse who accidentally dropped the vaccine vial and the assistant who wore contact lenses manifested the most severe and longest clinical manifestations, for 2 weeks.”Interestingly, none of the 2,296 recipients of the injections reported any symptoms, at least not immediately.“We hypothesise, after finding no other likely association, such as contamination of cleaning agents or malfunction of ventilation system, that the evaporated solution of the vaccine was associated with ocular surface erosions of the affected personnel,” the study authors wrote.“… the excipients or aluminum hydroxide adjuvant may be the likely chemicals that associated with the adverse reactions.”In the comments, someone wrote that a doctor who previously researched the contents of the vials, focusing primarily on the nanotech aspects, said before his death that the secret to finding out what is actually in them is to wait three days while it dries.“And people are happy to be injected with this toxic fluid?” asked another. “Astounding.”Over at Natural News, a commenter reiterated the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has never been isolated and that the media is just fabricating fear and terror over what amounts to a bad seasonal flu.																
20	0	A group of four professors out of Europe is petitioning BioNTech for answers as to why the company’s mRNA “vaccines” for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) contain strange “grey shade” contents inside the vials.Jörg Matysik, Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the University of Leipzig; Gerald Dyker, Professor of Organic Chemistry at the Ruhr University Bochum; Andreas Schnepf, Professor of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Tübingen; and Martin Winkler, Professor Materials and Process Engineering at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, all want to know why the injection contains a “white to grey-white dispersion” unlike any other vaccine.“How does this significant colour difference come about; virtually all the substances used are colourless, so white would be expected. Where does the shade of grey come from? Are these impurities?” the professors asked.Schnepf stated about the “diluted black” color is “hardly created in a process that would be expected.”“We need to know if it is an impurity,” he added. “If a pill is not white, there is a suspicion that something has gone wrong. We need clarification from BioNTech on this.”In their joint letter, Schnepf and his colleagues probed BioNTech even more about how uniform product is ensured, “or rather how can you ensure that the mRNA to be packaged is present in the lipid nanoparticles and to what extent?”“How do you continue to control the concentration of mRNA active ingredient in each batch, and how do you control the concentration of active ingredient in the lipid nanoparticles relative to that outside the particles?” the letter further reads.Certain chemical components used in the vaccines “are not approved for human medicine,” reveals package insertAnother thing the professors are demanding answers about is the label on BioNTech’s injection, which states that the vials contain “components used in the vaccine that are not approved for human medicine.”Just what, exactly, are these mystery components? They are called ALC-0159 and ALC-0315, and BioNTech says they are “used to form the lipid nanoparticles.”The safety data sheet for ALC-0315 clearly reveals that it “irritates both eyes and skin or mucous membranes,” which Schnepf says is a serious problem because what is to say that this chemical will not do the same thing to tissues throughout the body?“Here we need clarity,” Schnepf said. “Are there any further planned or ongoing studies to determine the toxicological effects of the substances or their biological degradation?”Another major concern is, of course, side effects. Some lots of the vaccine appear to be much deadlier than other lots. How and why is this the case?These side effects, the professors added to their letter, “are correlated with a small number of batch numbers.”“How can this circumstance be explained and what distinguishes these batches from the others, and are efforts underway to investigate this important aspect in more detail, especially with regard to quality assurance? Are there or are clinical studies planned to investigate the side effects and their causes as well as to increase the safety of the new Covid vaccines?”Chances are that BioNTech will provide bogus answers to all of these questions, assuming the company responds at all. Big Pharma is notorious for lying and getting away with murder – literally.Last summer, strange grey matter appeared in vials of covid vaccine from Moderna, prompting the government of Japan to halt all further administration of the drug.The grey vials were magnetic, a Japanese ministry official announced, suggesting that “it could be metal.” To this day, it is still unknown the true contents of these injections.																
21	0	In late 2021, U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman ordered Pfizer to release all relevant data on their “covid-19 vaccine.” The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tried to protect Pfizer, suggesting that the data be kept classified for the next twenty years. However, the courts ordered the speedy release of the information, demanding transparency for a product that has been used arrogantly and tyrannically to destroy people’s livelihoods and health.As the documents are released to the public at the rate of 55,000 pages per month, researchers are documenting the truth about the covid-19 vaccines. For one, these injections use RNA replication technology to exploit the innate immune system, to mass produce a variant of the spike protein bioweapon. This has led to widespread immune depletion and enhanced disease, causing higher caseloads, hospitalizations and deaths. Furthermore, Pfizer’s own documents prove THEY KNEW their covid vaccines were not “safe and effective.” Pfizer also knew the mRNA nano-particles circulated throughout the body, causing damage to organs. The FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) anyway, lying to the public about the “safety” and “efficacy” of the vaccine.Criminal negligence or criminal conspiracy: unraveling Pfizer and FDA deception about covid-19 vaccinesThere are only two explanations for the FDA’s behavior in this historic matter of medical malpractice: criminal negligence or criminal conspiracy. Either the FDA negligently disregarded the data in these documents, or they actively participated in a criminal conspiracy to commit fraud and cause harm to the population. Why would the FDA blindly trust a company (Pfizer) that previously promoted pharmaceutical products illegally, leading to the largest health care fraud settlement in the history of the Justice Department? With the Pfizer documents being made public, both Pfizer and the FDA should be charged. They should be charged for not only promoting pharmaceutical products illegally, but also for using deception and coercion to force harmful products on the population.The Pfizer documents raise serious public health issues. At least 50,000 pages have been released thus far. In the documents, Pfizer reassured the FDA repeatedly that their vaccine would “prevent” covid-19, even though the study design utilized fraudulent diagnostic standards to manipulate end points, while ignoring absolute risk reduction. Pfizer understood that vaccinated individuals can still test positive for covid-19, and may still get the same respiratory symptoms, even after suffering from the side effects of the vaccine. Yet, Pfizer repeatedly claimed that their vaccine would “prevent” covid-19 – lying to the FDA about is effectiveness.In the documents, Pfizer indicated that the vaccine be used for “active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals ? 16 years of age.” However, Pfizer and the FDA also had data showing that the “efficacy” of the vaccine waned quickly. The data shows that the effects of the vaccine wane in just one month, even after two doses are administered. However, the FDA did not warn the public that vaccinated individuals would need monthly boosters to make the vaccine work.Pfizer and FDA had clear evidence that vaccine causes widespread damagePfizer also had overwhelming data on the adverse events of the vaccine. The drug company knew that the adverse events increased with each additional booster shot, yet the FDA approved a two-shot protocol from the start and even approved a third booster, despite evidence of mounting health risks. In a series of documents, Pfizer wrote on page 24 about the dose-dependent nature of adverse events, which included severe grades of edema and erythema along with muscle necrosis, fibrosis and increased spleen size and weight. “The incidence and severity of the reactions were higher after the second or third injections compared with the first injection,” Pfizer wrote.Pfizer also had proof that the mRNA nano-particles migrated from the injection site, yet the government and the media repeatedly lied about the mRNA degrading and the whole process staying in the deltoid muscles. The vaccine ingredients migrated predominantly to the ovaries, liver and spleen, but also proliferated the adrenal glands, bladder, bone, bone marrow, eyes, large intestine, lymph nodes, pancreas, salivary glands, skin, small intestine, testes, thymus, thyroid and the uterus.Pfizer and the FDA had clear data showing more systemic adverse events occurring in the vaccinated group over the placebo group, yet they both lied to the public, claiming that the vaccinated had mild disease and the unvaccinated were a “public health threat.” Pfizer knew that the vaccinated were two to twenty-five times more likely to experience negative health impacts from the vaccine.In the documents, Pfizer adamantly preferred a passive adverse event surveillance system that relied on unsubstantiated reports that could be readily dismissed. Pfizer did not want to take on the added cost of accurately recording vaccine injuries, nor did they want to compensate families injured by their vaccines. Clearly, neither Pfizer, the FDA or the CDC gave proper informed consent for these vaccines, harming countless people for life, while lying to the public with disinformation and damaging the public’s trust.																
22	0	Mega-rich, fake philanthropist Bill Gates has been exposed, through his own admissions on video, saying that he wants to rid the planet of a few billion people, so he’s in damage control mode now, showing up on fake news everywhere trying to seem like a nice guy who cares. Recently divorced from Melinda, Bill the “pharma shill” Gates, has launched a campaign of disinformation about Covid vaccines, global warming and GMOs in food in order to fulfill his depopulation agenda. As of late, Bill Gates is blaming the unvaccinated for spreading death, instead of the deadly Covid-19 vaccines he’s funding and promoting so virulently with propaganda.The tech geek billionaire is wildly claiming that 95 percent of all Covid deaths so far are unvaccinated people, which is impossible data for him to have already acquired. In fact, it’s mostly the other way around, where the vaccinated are dying off quickly, and nobody is sure whether it’s from Covid, Delta, or the blood-clotting mRNA and protein-payload Covid vaccines.Vaccine-promoting, globalist-psychopath Bill Gates apologizes for being friends with a child rapistBill Gates says his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein was a “huge mistake” as people are finding out he “hung out” with the ‘suicided’ child-rapist on a regular basis.

Is that why the FBI raided the estate, to protect the perv-elites?Brighteon.TVMelinda Gates divorced Bill Gates because of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, by the way. Why would she be so upset that he simply “knows” another billionaire?

Then Gates admitted after several more questions from Cooper that “it was a huge mistake to spend time with him…” and then Gates said there were “lots of others in that same situation.” What “situation” is that Bill, that Epstein now had leverage on you?In this video, Bill Gates brags at a TED conference about killing billions of people using vaccines and abortions.

The FDA regulates GMO animals as “drugs.” Do people need a  prescription to eat GM salmon? Are your children’s doctors shooting deadly, experimental and untested GMOs into your children’s veins? Will the new Covid vaccines create humans who experience trillions of blood clots constantly from the protein prions their cells are now instructed to create?In this video, Bill “Eugenics” Gates tries to explain why is he buying a quarter-million acres of farmland in USA (Louisiana, Arkansas and Nebraska mainly), making him the #1 private farmland owner in the country. We find out much more about the hidden agenda of GM-salmon, and how they will be “released” into restaurants without anyone knowing, and soon.Watch and listen to Bill Gates admit the insanity of the Covid vaccines, literally warning us that there’s something to be worried about with modern medicine, about side effects, like from the Covid jabs:“We’re taking things that are genetically modified organisms, and we’re injecting them into little kid’s arms, we just SHOOT them right into the veins.”   — Bill GatesCheck out Pandemic.news for updates on these crimes against humanity and the upcoming “Delta” and Covid “booster-vaccine” Holocaust.

23	0	The Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines are mass murder weapons, deadlier than guns, cannons and tanks combined.This surfaced after an analysis of figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database revealed that 61,000 people, supposedly in the prime of their life, ages 25-44, died of vaccine-related causes in the U.S. in the fall and winter of 2021.Edward Dowd, a former BlackRock portfolio manager, made the appalling revelation during the March 10 episode of “The Alex Jones Show.”According to Dowd, an investment adviser on Wall Street, an insurance industry expert who is part of his team stumbled upon the buried truth when, looking for something else, he broke down the CDC figures by age and created his own baseline death rates from there.Showing charts the actuarian plotted from the figures, Dowd pointed at chart four as the punch line.“Basically, you see that millennials experienced 84 percent excess death in the fall and winter of 2021. So excess deaths accelerated when mandates and boosters hit,” Dowd told Jones.“And this age group is important because they’re healthy. And you can’t say that they, you know, miss their cancer screenings. This is ages 25 to 44. So this is just devastating evidence that the vaccines are causing this age group to die at an accelerating rate. (Related: Life insurance companies sound DEATH ALERT warnings over nearly 100,000 excess deaths per month happening right now in the USA.)“I know I showed percentages in that chart, but the actual bodies are 61,000. That’s the Vietnam War event that just occurred to the millennial generation – 58,000 died in the Vietnam War.”Brighteon.TVDowd said he’s certain the vaccines are the culprits because the acceleration started in the summer when the mandates started hitting in August and September last year.“And then [President Joe] Biden came out [announcing the mandates]. And boosters were also authorized and started happening. So let’s call this what it is. This is death by government mandate or democide, death by government. That’s what’s going on here.”The insurance companies have pointed at the alarming spike in vaccine-related deaths before, but the government refused to heed the warning and proceeded with the mass injections.Dowd could only speculate on why the “pyschos” in government did this.“Well, there’s two ways to look at this. Just good old-fashioned power and greed, or there was a plan hatched by some very evil people. I’m going with power and greed for now. But you know, as we roll through this very active fraud, it’s being exposed. There’s more and more evidence coming to the front that this is part of some sort of bigger grand plan.”Dowd’s suspicion grew after noticing that what’s happening in the U.S. is being replicated by other global governments that have mandated the vaccines.Government’s war on people“So this is a worldwide tragedy. And it’s a war. And whether the government knew it was a war on people, they’re currently at war on their own people. And it’s the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”Dowd related that a board member of a German insurer approached him two weeks ago and revealed their government was underreporting vaccine-related injuries by a factor of 25 to one. That is based on approximately three million Germans, or 3.6 percent of the total population, who were injured by vaccines enough to seek medical treatment.No wonder, Dowd is leaning toward the grand plan scheme now.That’s why his team is going to drop more charts, all interpreting the CDC data, until the true reason why there were more deaths in 2021 than 2020 is exposed.Citing more figures, Dowd said the over 65 generation saw 306,000 excess deaths in the second half of last year until February. “That is a World War II event,” explained Dowd, noting over 291,000 Americans died in the war. Dowd also pointed out that there’s a little over 1.1 million people in excess deaths in the U.S. since the pandemic began.Putting that figure into perspective, Dowd said “1.1 million excess deaths equates to 4,000 World Trade Center events.”And still, the mainstream media is talking about Ukraine, Dowd lamented. “We just literally had a war here on our own soil. “We’re at war with someone and it’s occurring.”																
24	0	As predicted, the Big Pharma machine is already talking about pushing a fourth Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) “vaccine” on the masses in a way similar to seasonal flu shots.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla appeared on CBS News‘ “Face the Nation” with Margaret Brennan to deliver pre-scripted talking points about how people are going to need a fourth injection in order to stay “immune” against the Fauci Flu.“Do you think that we will every fall have to prepare ourselves with a booster shot for COVID just like we get a flu shot?” Brennan asked Bourla.“I think so,” he responded.“Many variants are coming and omicron was the first one that was able to evade in a skillful way the immune protection that we are giving. But also in order, the duration of the protection doesn’t last very long. So, what we are trying to do is to make not only a vaccine that will protect against all variants, including omicron, but also something that can protect for at least a year.”You can watch a clip of the segment below.According to Bourla, it is absolutely necessary that people get a “fourth boost” because the third shot, which was originally called a “booster,” is “not that good against infections and it doesn’t last that long.”“Right now, the protection that we are getting from the third, it is good enough, actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths,” Bourla said, though he admitted that the third shot is pretty much useless for infections.Brighteon.TV“We are just submitting data to the FDA and will wait to hear what other experts say outside of Pfizer.”Bourla wants everyone to get injected with annual Pfizer COVID shotsPeople have been banned on social media platforms like Twitter for saying the very same thing that Bourla is now admitting about the shots not working as claimed, by the way. But for some reason, Bourla always gets a free pass to say whatever he wants.At one point, Bourla actually called for parents who utter “disinformation” about his Pfizer shots to be punished as criminals.Bourla’s company also said that it is “proud to stand with China leaders” as among its many globalist partners pushing new pharmaceutical “innovations” like Fauci Flu shots. Bourla said Pfizer is now working “very diligently” to come up with an annual injection that will supposedly provide year-long protection against all versions of the Fauci Flu that will inevitably be announced by the White House and its corporate-controlled media partners.“Pretty ballsy of him not to have fled the country yet,” wrote one commenter about Bourla.“He certainly is not reading the room,” joked another about how Bourla clearly does not understand how most people feel concerning his injections.“I will never trust a doctor ever again, nor any government agency trying to tell us what to do to be ‘safe,'” wrote someone else. “Too many sold their souls and could give a s**t about our individual health; only drink the kool-aid and follow the globalist agenda.”Another pointed out that if Bourla gets his wish about a fourth COVID “booster” injection, there will surely be a fifth, sixth, seventh and infinite number of additional shots pushed on the masses.“This guy is stalling and awaiting bought approval for the next mRNA disease panacea,” suggested someone else. “The infrastructure is now in place for the next mass rollouts of low temp product. They are not going to let it all go away. Pumping boosters until then.”																
25	0	Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proves that there was a surge in deaths among millennials in the United States after the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandates were implemented.According to the data, the millennial generation in the U.S. suffered more than 61,000 excess deaths during the second half of 2021 alone.Edward Dowd, a former portfolio manager for Wall Street investment firm BlackRock, who made a career out of crunching numbers to make important investment decisions, recently went public with his analysis of CDC data.On the social media website Gettr, where Dowd first published the results of his analysis, he wrote that the millennial generation experienced “a Vietnam War event,” noting that 58,000 Americans died during that conflict.“Understand this data comes from the CDC,” said The New American journalist Ben Armstrong on an episode of his show on the media network, “The Ben Armstrong Show.”“So, you know, it’s most likely even worse than what I’m reporting, because you know, the CDC has not been forthright and everything,” he continued. (Related: ALARM BELLS: All-cause death rates in US have increased by 40% compared to pre-pandemic levels.)“You could say the CDC conducted a Vietnam War on millennials,” said Armstrong. “And I think this is the low-end stuff, folks. It’s using the CDC, who has been covering up and lying to everybody [about] their own stuff, so you know it has to be on the low-end. It has to be. This is the stuff that they think looks good.”Brighteon.TVMillennials experienced “worst-ever excess mortality” event due to COVID-19 vaccinesIn an interview with Steve Bannon’s show “War Room,” Dowd described what he found as “shocking” and called it the “worst-ever excess mortality, I think, in history.”According to Dowd’s analysis, millennials in the U.S., or people between the ages of 25 and 40, experienced an 84 percent increase in excess mortality in the fall of 2021.This was the highest increase in excess deaths among all age groups last year. It was seven times higher than excess deaths among the Silent Generation, born between 1928 to 1945, with the youngest members of that generation being 76 years old.Dowd’s data also highlights that the surge in excess deaths hit millennials at the same time the COVID-19 vaccine mandates were introduced.“And then [excess deaths] re-accelerated into the end of the year,” said Dowd. This coincides with the time when the COVID-19 booster vaccines were introduced in the United States.“I think this is the smoking gun that the vaccines are causing excess mortality in all age groups,” said Dowd. “So, I’m going to put a word out there. It’s an old word but it should be reintroduced into the conversation. It’s called democide: Death by government. So the government, through the mandates, has killed people.”Dowd noted that the estimate of 61,000 excess deaths among millennials in 2021 is a low estimate. “It takes time for millennial-aged deaths to be reported because they’re usually not hospital deaths,” he said. “So, that data’s going to be updated and it’s probably gonna show that continued, disturbing trend.”Dowd said he worked with an insurance expert in compiling and analyzing the data. He also worked with Brook Jackson, a whistleblower who was contracted to work on one of Pfizer’s clinical trials for its vaccine.An acquaintance on Wall Street, who Dowd called a senior chief risk officer, or an actuary, learned about Dowd’s research and asked to compare notes. This leads Dowd to believe that the financial community will soon respond to the excess deaths caused by the vaccines.“If you’re on Wall Street and you still think Pfizer and Moderna are good buys, I’ve got news for you: There’s some catalysts coming that are probably not going to be good for holding those stocks,” said Dowd. He added that the liability protections afforded to Big Pharma companies by the federal government will probably not protect them this time.																
26	0	A blogger who calls himself “A Midwestern Doctor” has issued a warning that Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) “vaccine” adverse events are far more prominent than many people realize.Potentially millions of “fully vaccinated” people are now suffering with a range of jab-induced illnesses that may or may not be curable. And the unfortunate reality for them is that they will probably never find the answers or solutions they need.“I’ve tried to use very neutral language to describe these events, but this has been a very difficult process for me to watch,” the doctor wrote, referring to the many stories that are pouring in from jab-damaged folks.“Many of the people I know and have guided through the process have access to options for mitigating these injuries, something most people don’t. I’ve read through various support groups, and in general found their experiences are typically worse than what I am describing here as they are not privileged to have access to way to mitigate the harm.”Initially, it was believed that the more serious side effects, at least, would be minimal. Only a tiny fraction of people, we were told, would even know they took the shots afterwards because their health would be just fine. This is proving to be false.“Once the vaccine was release to the general public, I began seeing patients appear for various acute autoimmune and neurological conditions (I would classify as ‘moderate’) immediately following vaccination at a much higher rate than I had expected,” the doctor wrote.“Each time they told me the other doctors they saw either insisted the reaction was either not linked to vaccination, or the fact they had the reaction was a really good sign, because if they ended up getting COVID the adverse event would have been much, much worse. Shortly after, I then began having friends contact me inquiring if the vaccine could cause a fatal heart attack or stroke, something I had not anticipated would occur.”COVID injections are causing “very strange effects” that doctors “cannot explain the mechanism forAs the official narrative surrounding the “safe and effective” injections continued to crumble, the doctor began compiling data to compare what is actually happening in real life to what the corporate-controlled media and the government are claiming is the case.“My primary reason for all of this is that everyone likes to say ‘severe reactions to vaccines are 1/1,000,000,” the doctor adds. “My logic was there is absolutely no way I know 1,000,000 people through one degree of separation.”“My guess is I know 50,000-100,000 people through one degree of separation so at the absolutely most I will hear of 10 percent of the cases (probably less) within this sample, so if I have at least 10 cases of severe injury within this sample that is a large red flag.”Among the deadly side effects observed by the doctor are:• Strokes, likely strokes and blood clots• Hemorrhages• Heart conditions• Sudden death (unknown cause)• Anaphylaxis and allergies• Other neurological conditions• Psychiatric conditions• Autoimmune disorders and chronic fatigue• Immune suppression and cancer• Menstrual irregularities and miscarriages• Birth defectsThere are also other “very strange effects,” the doctor further noted, that “I cannot explain the mechanism for.” This is perhaps due to the fact that messenger RNA (mRNA) technology has never before been used in humans, and thus the damage it causes is new to those in the medical field.																
27	0	If Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccines” are really “safe and effective” as the government claims, then why are there hundreds of stories about people who were seriously injured or killed by them documented in detail at CovidVaccineVictims.com?Founded in January 2021 on Telegram, CovidVaccineVictims.com is a new resource where you can read all about the many people whose lives were destroyed by Fauci Flu shots. It is a sobering experience to look through them all, but it is also an important one that might help to bring positive change to the current trajectory.Since we are constantly being told by the “authorities” that there is no reason not to get jabbed with a Wuhan Flu shot, CovidVaccineVictims.com is a powerful rebuttal to that unsubstantiated claim.“President” Joe Biden, for instance, whined recently that there is no good reason for anyone who is “unvaccinated” to wait any longer. He then proceeded to whisper in the ear of America that everyone needs to “get vaccinated” promptly – what are you waiting for?The answer to that question, Pedo Joe, is that people who are actually doing their homework know that Chinese Virus injections are not safe, nor are they effective. They are harming more people than any other jab ever has.How many more people need to die before the covid vaccine genocide comes to an end?One of the victims shown on the site is Erica Kay Darr, 40, who “passed away unexpectedly following a Covid-19 vaccine.” Another is 56-year-old Fernando Katukina, an indigenous American who suffered fatal cardiac arrest after his injection.Brighteon.TVForty-four-year-old Stefano Paternò from Italy died just 16 hours after getting injected with the AstraZeneca vaccine. His brain began to bleed until he eventually passed away, leaving behind a wife and two children.A young woman from Israel by the name of Shirel Hilel, 22, developed severe inflammation of the heart after receiving a Pfizer injection. She later died of cardiac arrest.Rapper DMX (born Earl Simmons) is also listed as a victim, as he, too, died from cardia arrest not long after receiving his injection.Davide Bristot, an 18-year-old from Italy, was also reported dead not long after receiving his Chinese Flu shot. He and many other young people listed on the site were healthy and normal prior to their injections.All ages, races and body types are depicted in the archive, suggesting that Chinese Virus jabs do not necessarily discriminate based on pre-existing health conditions or body fat content.One of the victims shown was a 26-year-old doctor from India who took the jab and began to feel unwell. Her husband, who is also a doctor, quickly administered pain medication but the woman passed just hours later while at the hospital.TheCovidBlog.com is another site where you will find stories about people whose lives were ruined or ended by Wuhan Flu shots. These are presented more as blog articles, while the stories at CovidVaccineVictims.com are displayed as picture tiles where you can see the victims’ faces.CovidVaccineVictims.com also has a podcast section where you can listen to a series called “Voices of the Victims.” Each episode features interviews with people who have either experienced or witnessed an injury or death caused by covid injections.A quick note from the author of this story: It has come to my attention that some shared Wi-Fi networks will not allow access to CovidVaccineVictims.com. An erroneous pop-up message claims that the site poses “phishing” risks. If you experience this, let us know about it in the comment section. It would seem as though the powers that be really do not want this information to get out there.																
28	0	Imogen Allen was healthy and spry prior to getting “vaccinated” for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19). Now, however, the 22-year-old champion show jumper has developed two massive blood clots in her lungs that could prevent her from ever riding again.As we have come to expect, the mainstream media is calling Allen’s clots “an incredibly rare reaction,” even though it is one of the most common adverse effects to occur post-jab.According to reports, Allen was taking contraceptives at the time when she got injected with Fauci Flu shots. This, the corporate media is insinuating, could be the real cause behind Allen’s newly formed blood clots.Allen took the Moderna injections that were pushed by Donald “father of the vaccine” Trump under “Operation Warp Speed,” which sent the experimental jabs to the four corners of the world in a matter of weeks.Trusting what the “authorities” were telling everyone, Allen rolled up her sleeve believing that it would help to “flatten the curve” while keeping her “safe.” Instead, she was left for dead by the Big Pharma poison.While Allen is still alive, she will probably never ride horses again because a simple bump to the head or even a cut could kill her since she will have to take blood-thinning medication for the rest of her life.Allen might also have to get surgery due to the clots that developed in her lungs just days after being injected with Moderna’s mRNA clot shot. Life as she once knew it is now gone forever.Brighteon.TV“I was always wary of something happening, and it just shows that I had every right to be, because look at me now,” Allen is quoted as saying.Fauci Flu shots are destroying lives one injection at a timeIt was first discovered that something was wrong with Allen after she collapsed during a recent family holiday with her boyfriend. Allen was later diagnosed with a bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism.Allen had just secured a job as a police officer, but is now being recommended to forego that position, which she desired all her life, because her vaccine-induced illness could prevent her from performing her duties as needed.Allen is hoping to reapply for the position at some point in the future, assuming her health improves. If she has to stay on blood thinners for the rest of her life, though, that might never happen.“It’s devastating,” Allen told the British media. “I have been interested in the police since I was 18. I have absolutely no idea what I’m going to do now. Work isn’t even on the horizon.”Every day since getting jabbed, Allen has been mostly confined to her bed. She described her new post-vaccine life as “depressing,” calling it “a massive setback” for everything she had planned for the future.“Even brushing my teeth and hair I was panting and had to take breaks,” Allen says about what the jab did to her. “Sleeping on my side just felt like it was crushing my lungs. It was like every breath I took just didn’t do anything.”As part of her post-injection treatments, Allen has had to suffer through numerous excruciating injections that were jabbed into her belly. These injections contained various drug cocktails supposedly designed to relieve some of the strain on her heart.Allen says the many hours she has had to spend alone in the hospital because of her country’s Chinese Virus restriction was something “like a horror film.”“Yeah, this is really bad,” Allen is quoted as saying.																
29	0	A vaccinologist at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota said he developed tinnitus after his second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.(Article by Nolan E. Bowman republished from ChildrensHealthDefense.org)Dr. Gregory Poland’s symptoms began 90 minutes after receiving the vaccine. He described the condition as “fairly severe” and “extraordinarily bothersome, interfering with sleep and the ability to concentrate.”Tinnitus is defined as hearing sounds when no actual, external sounds are present. Some people report:Ringing in the ears.Buzzing, hissing, whistling, swooshing and clicking.Thumping.Hearing music when none is being played.According to data released March 4 by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), 19,630 people have reported developing tinnitus after a COVID vaccine. There are no VAERS data on whether or not this condition resolved or is ongoing.A Dec. 14, 2021 Johnson & Johnson (J&J) “Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers” lists tinnitus as a side effect of the Janssen COVID vaccine, marketed by J&J.Pfizer and Moderna do not note any causal connection between the vaccine and hearing issues, according to ABC News, and neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nor U.S. Food and Drug Administration list the condition as a side effect.Tinnitus is also a symptom of COVID, especially among “long-haulers.” Texas Roadhouse CEO Kent Taylor last year committed suicide after experiencing severe post-COVID symptoms, including tinnitus.Brighteon.TVSpike protein in virus, vaccine may cause trigger tinnitusPoland last month hosted a video discussion with two leading tinnitus researchers, Konstantina Stankovic, M.D., Ph.D., and Shaowen Bao, Ph.D., during which they  examined the mechanisms of tinnitus.Stankovic, a professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, has been studying tinnitus in COVID patients since the beginning of the pandemic.Of the 10 patients she studied who had COVID and tinnitus, all of them had “either reduced or non-existent hair function.”She found the virus entered the inner ear cells and “preferentially affected hair cells,” referring to the hair cells of the cochlea, an integral part of the inner ear and the organ responsible for the conversion of sound into an electrical signal the brain then interprets.“The virus causing COVID-19 can directly infect the human inner ear cells, and this could explain what we are seeing,” Stankovic said.Researchers estimate nearly 15% of people who recovered from COVID developed tinnitus, and this condition is now associated with long COVID.Poland, who got a booster shot despite developing tinnitus after his second COVID shot, raised the question of whether or not that was the right thing to do.Bao, an associate professor at the University of Arizona, said his research on vaccine-induced tinnitus, which is awaiting peer review, indicates the spike protein —  present in the virus and in the vaccine — is a likely contributor to tinnitus.Although Bao did not identify a molecular mechanism for spike protein-induced tinnitus, results from his own survey indicate the incidence of tinnitus following the first shot is 10% higher than that following the second shot, a small but statistically significant percentage.This indicates a spike protein-mediated effect and not an immune response effect because the immune response is known to be greater after the second dose, Bao said.From his survey of 400 people who developed post-vaccination tinnitus, 100 chose to receive a second dose of the vaccine despite having unresolved tinnitus from the first injection, Bao said. Of those 100 people, 38% reported worsening symptoms after the second dose, a much higher risk than the 70 per million cases reported in VAERS.Bao concluded that, for unknown reasons, some people are more predisposed than others to this adverse event.Poland decided to get the booster shot. His tinnitus went away for about 24 hours only to return at a higher pitch, he said.Poland did not return calls from The Defender about whether his condition has improved and if he reported it to VAERS.More research needed, experts say“These experts’ observations highlight the challenge we have in identifying the real cause of the conditions endured by people during the pandemic,” said Dr. Madhava Setty, senior science editor for The Defender.Setty added:“The spike protein has been implicated as the cause of many ailments following both vaccination and COVID-19, from myocarditis to clotting disorders. We cannot know which is more dangerous, the virus or the vaccine, if we do not have a large number of unvaccinated people to observe.”The American Tinnitus Association (ATA) encourages people who develop tinnitus after a COVID vaccine to report it to VAERS.The association states that manufacturers of COVID vaccines currently don’t list tinnitus as an expected adverse reaction (although, as reported, J&J does list it).The ATA states:“At present, none of the available coronavirus vaccines include information on tinnitus as a side effect. It is only through the reporting of side effects that adjustments are made in the list of common or rare side effects, so please report any adverse events that occur after vaccination.”Poland, Stankovic and Bao concluded tinnitus should not deter people from getting their booster shots, and said more research on tinnitus is desperately needed due to its “tremendous ill effect on people’s health and well-being and healthcare costs.”According to the ATA:“Millions of Americans experience tinnitus, often to a debilitating degree, making it one of the most common health conditions in the country. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that nearly 15% of the general public — over 50 million Americans — experience some form of tinnitus. Roughly 20 million people struggle with burdensome chronic tinnitus, while 2 million have extreme and debilitating cases.”Scientists and doctors are still getting a better understanding of this condition and ways to treat it, Bao and Stankovic said. A variety of causes have been identified, and some people experience it as an acute, temporary condition, while for others it is chronic and ongoing. It can also lead to hearing loss.There are no available evidence-based therapeutics for treating tinnitus. Some people have seen positive results with white noise therapy. Targeting inflammation might yield the best therapeutic strategies, Bao said.																
30	0	The CEO of one of Germany’s largest health insurance carriers was abruptly fired from his job last month after releasing truthful data about Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccine” injuries.Andreas Schofbeck of BKK / ProVita, whom we have reported on in the past, reported an unexpected jump in jab-related health insurance claims. In February, he notified the Paul Ehrlich Institute about it, PEI being the German equivalent of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Schofbeck’s BKK filing exposed the PEI for underreporting adverse events related to Fauci Flu shots. Here is part of what Schofbeck wrote in his letter to the PEI about this anomaly:“If these figures are extrapolated to the whole year and to the population in Germany, probably 2.5-3 million people in Germany have received medical treatment for vaccination side effects after Corona vaccination.”Dr. Dirk Heinrich, chairman of NAV-Virchow Bund, an association of private medical practitioners in Germany, responded with claims that the PEI and BKK will be working closely together to examine the billing code data. He went on to blast Schofbeck’s letter as “complete nonsense.”Truth be told, Schofbeck’s letter is anything but complete nonsense. If anything tells a more accurate story about Wuhan Flu shot damage, it is health insurance data.“… that’s because insurers are highly motivated to carefully track any anomalies in their data that could profoundly affect their profits and losses,” explains The Defender.Brighteon.TV“The BKK data, in concert with U.S. insurance industry data and adverse event reports collected by a survey conducted by the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH), reveal an emerging pattern of underreporting of COVID vaccine-related injuries and deaths.”German authorities refuse to acknowledge the deadly truth about covid injectionsAccording to Schofbeck’s letter, which is dated February 21, data from some 10.9 million people was analyzed. Based on this, it was discovered that 216,695 people were being treated for a covid jab adverse event during the first 2.5 quarters of 2021.Extrapolated over an entire year for a population of 83 million people, this data suggests that as many as 2.5 to 3 million people are likely receiving treatment for a Fauci Flu shot injury, or about 4-5 percent of all “fully vaccinated” people in Germany.“Our first assumption is that, since no compensation is paid for reporting vaccine adverse events, reporting to the Paul Ehrlich Institute is often not done because of the great expense involved,” Schofbeck explains in the letter.“Physicians have reported to us that reporting a suspected vaccine adverse event takes about half an hour. This means that 3 million suspected cases of vaccine adverse events require about 1.5 million working hours of physicians.”In conclusion, Schofbeck warned that this serves as a “significant warning signal” about the true risk associated with covid injections, adding that their “danger to human life cannot be ruled out.”Despite claiming publicly that it would work with BKK to review the data, the PEI has done absolutely nothing, and Schofbeck is no longer BKK / ProVita’s CEO.German researcher and physician Dr. Florian Schilling conducted an analysis as well, which found that the PEI’s reported numbers for covid jab injuries in 2021 were seven times lower than BKK’s calculations.“PEI’s reported numbers were 13.86 times lower than BKK’s projections when compared to the 14 month period since the vaccine rollout,” The Defender reported.“Using this factor, Schilling calculated more than 400,000 serious AEs and over 31,000 deaths from AEs have occurred since the beginning of the vaccination campaign.”Indiana-based OneAmerica, another life insurance carrier, has similarly reported a “stunning” 40 percent increase in deaths compared to pre-covid jab levels.																
31	0	Contrary to what we have all been led to believe, there is still no available vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the “prevention of COVID-19 disease in individuals 16 years of age and older.”Pfizer’s “Comirnaty” injection was approved (sort of) back in the fall, however it is not legally interchangeable with the Pfizer injections that people have been receiving under emergency use authorization (EUA).This distinction has created a lot of confusion over whether or not the jabs can legally be pushed on the masses. It turns out that they cannot, though this is being done anyway using sleight of hand.On August 23, the FDA did supposedly grant full approval for Comirnaty, which the Biden regime used as leverage to coerce millions into taking the shots. However, Comirnaty has not yet made its way into the United States and there appears to be no plans to make it available here anytime soon.“As a reasonable explanation, early on, Pfizer and its government allies claimed that Comirnaty was not yet available because the EUA shots were still lining the shelves, and the FDA-approved version would soon be made available to all,” reported Great Game India about the situation.“It has been over 4 months now, since full approval, but Comirnaty is still not being distributed.”Law passed under Reagan requires that experimental children’s-version vaccines receive full approval before drug companies can obtain stronger legal immunityIt is important to emphasize that the FDA recognizes Comirnaty as a “legally distinct” product with “certain differences” compared to the EUA product from Pfizer-BioNTech.At the same time, the FDA, which has financial ties to Pfizer, claims that the safety and effectiveness of both the EUA and the approved shots is the same.“‘Fact checkers’ leverage the latter point of safety and efficacy to claim that people are still getting access to ingredients akin to the fully approved product,” Great Game India added.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also confirmed that Comirnaty is “not orderable at this time,” and that “Pfizer does not plan to produce any product with these NDCs (National Drug Codes) and labels over the next few months while EUA authorized product is still available and being made available for U.S. distribution.”Why, you might be asking, is Pfizer refusing to make the fully authorized version available? The answer appears to be that Pfizer does not want to open itself up to legal liability issues.While an EUA does fully protect a drug-maker while granting zero legal recourse to the patient, a law passed during the Reagan Administration requires that a drug first secure full approval for the children’s version of the jab before more robust legal immunity from lawsuits for injuries and deaths can be granted.“The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which was passed into law in 1986, provides a legal liability shield to drug manufacturers if they receive full authorization for all ages,” reports explain.“Now is this the reason why Pfizer is seeking approval for children so that it can protect itself from lawsuits?”Since pharmaceutical companies are involved, this is almost guaranteed to be the case – because everyone knows that the drug industry only cares about one thing: profits. But is there another reason why not only Pfizer but also Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) are “working relentlessly to authorize their products for children, who face near-zero risk from COVID-19, but continue to showcase alarming side effects from the vaccine?”The answer appears to be that these company crave an extensive, additional layer of protection from lawsuits that can only be obtained if Comirnaty becomes available for all ages.																
32	0	In a recent interview with Nick De Bois, Jamie Jenkins, the former head of health and labor market analysis at the British Office for National Statistics, revealed a statistic that really puts into perspective the scam that is Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).In order to prevent just one person from having to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) for COVID, a shocking two million children must get “double-vaccinated” for the Fauci Flu.Keep in mind that children have zero risk of dying from COVID.Four million doses of the shots total must be dispensed into children’s arms, putting them at serious risk of adverse events, in order to stop one single person from getting admitted to an ICU somewhere.“JCVI has said that vaccination of children aged 5 to 11 years who are not in a clinical risk group would prevent a relatively small number of hospitalizations or intensive care admissions,” Jenkins’ website stated, citing other data from British health authorities.“For a variant like omicron, it would take around four million vaccine doses to two million children to prevent one admission to ICU.”To prevent one child hospitalization involving a less-severe illness, 58,000 other children would need to get vaccinated, Jenkins further revealed.“Children admitted recently to hospital with COVID had an average length of stay of 1-2 days,” he said. “The omicron wave saw no more children in hospital than before omicron hit in the United Kingdom.”Children 51 times more likely to die from jab than COVIDDr. Stephanie Seneff and researcher Kathy Dopp put together a cost-benefit analysis that further found that children under the age of 18 are 51 times more likely to die from the jab than they are from COVID if unvaccinated.It is far better, in other words, for a child to remain unvaccinated with natural immunity than it is for a child to get a potentially lethal COVID injection.The results of that cost-benefit analysis combined with the revelations that Jenkins put forth solidify the fact that getting jabbed for the Fauci Flu is a really bad thing to do, especially for children.As people figure this all out, billionaire eugenicist Bill Gates is really “sad,” saying that the omicron (moronic) variant came along and put a damper on the mass injection campaign.“Sadly, the virus itself, particularly the variant called omicron, is a type of vaccine in that it creates both T cell and B cell immunity, and it’s done a better job of getting out to the population than we have with vaccines,” Gates is quoted as saying.Pfizer is actually taking a step back from pushing its lethal injections on children and toddlers under five. For the time being, that push has been suspended – but chances are it will be resurrected at a later date when the next “variant” arrives.Meanwhile, evidence continues to mount showing that myocarditis risk in young vaccinated people, and especially young vaccinated men, is anything but “rare” as the corporate-controlled media and the government are claiming.Based on the latest data from Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the current rate of myocarditis is about 6.5 per 100,000 doses in the 12-17 age group.“Assuming the rate of myocarditis in 5- to 11-year-olds is identical to that of 12- to 17-year-olds, we could potentially be looking at 260 cases of myocarditis for every ICU admission for COVID that we prevent,” reported the Daily Exposé, referring to Jenkins’ ICU example.“On the whole, the COVID jab provides only risk for children under 18, so there’s absolutely no justification for it.”																
33	0	Pfizer document admits that covid “vaccines” cause severe adverse reactions03/07/2022 / By Ethan HuffInternal documentation from Pfizer reveals that the company’s Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccine” is anything but safe and effective.Starting on page 30 of a newly uncovered company document, an exhaustive list of serious adverse reactions to the shot is fully outlined. That list spans over eight full pages.Pfizer intended for this information to remain hidden from the public, warning that “dissemination of this information outside of Pfizer, its Affiliates, its Licensees, or Regulatory Agencies is strictly prohibited.”“The information contained in this document is proprietary and confidential,” the document further states.“Except as may be otherwise agreed to in writing, by accepting or reviewing these materials, you agree to hold such information in confidence and not to disclose it to others (except where required by applicable law), nor to use it for unauthorized purposes.”Fortunately for the public, the restricted document was leaked. We now know that Pfizer’s Fauci Flu shot causes an array of serious health problems including 1p36 deletion syndrome, which the National Library of Medicine (NLM) describes as “a disorder that typically causes severe intellectual disability.”1p36 deletion syndrome is pretty severe, it turns out, leaving most affected individuals unable to speak, “or speak only a few words.” Those who succumb to it can also “have temper tantrums, bite themselves, or exhibit other behavior problems.”The full list of “Adverse Events of Special Interest” caused by Pfizer’s covid injection is far too long to publish here, but you can read it in full at Newspunch.Will the plandemic criminals ever be held accountable for their crimes against humanity?As you will see, there are hundreds upon hundreds of side effects caused by the shots that the corporate-controlled media is refusing to acknowledge. The government is just as bad when it comes to hiding the truth about these serious risks.“The truth has been available for anyone wanting to look,” wrote someone at Newspunch about the situation. “It seems more of it comes out every day and is getting traction online and in some media.”“I can’t help but compare this to the CIA information management programs we’ve seen in the past,” this same person added. “Remember 911? Much outrage followed by an ‘official’ report. Now there exists enough widespread skepticism over the conspiracy that allowed 911 to create a Truth commission and subpoena all involved.”This will likely never happen, though, because it just never does. The culprits almost always get away with their crimes because too few people are willing to take them to task and hold them accountable.“It’s all in the past! Leave well-enough alone,” the same commenter wrote about how the tactic usually works. “Same pattern developing here … Bush, Fauci, Biden, and even Trump will be buried with honors and remembered as heroes.”Someone else thanked God for this and other information releases that have helped those who are paying attention avoid injuring or possibly killing themselves with these deadly injections.“I am so happy that I have faith in Him and not in man,” this person added. “God is great. Love Him so much.”Just days after the Pfizer injection was unleashed under Operation Warp Speed back in late December of 2021, Dr. James Lyons-Weiler confirmed that the Pfizer injection causes autoimmune disease. At the time, though, everyone was focused on the stolen election, so it all got buried.“They know word of mouth is the MOST potent form of information dispersal, so it’s pointless trying to [cover it up],” wrote another commenter about how the plandemic jig is just about up.																
34	0	As The Epoch Times and other media outlets reported yesterday, a shocking new study conducted at Lund University in Sweden has confirmed that mRNA nanoparticles from Pfizer’s covid-19 vaccine enter human cells and are reverse-transcripted into DNA, achieving a permanent alteration of the person’s genetic code.This is something that the CDC lied about for the last several years, claiming it was impossible.The study is published in the journal Molecular Biology. It’s entitled, “Intracellular Reverse Transcription of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 In Vitro in Human Liver Cell Line.”The study concludes that, “BNT162b2 mRNA is reverse transcribed intracellularly into DNA as fast as 6 [hours] after BNT162b2 exposure.”This means the vaccine alters your genetic code in mere hours after being injected. This may help explain why cancer rates are exploding in people who take covid vaccines. The integrity of their DNA is being destroyed.It is also yet more proof that the mRNA particles from the vaccine do, indeed, circulate throughout the body and don’t stay restricted to the injection site. That’s another lie told to the world by the CDC, Big Tech and the pharma-funded corporate media which has been caught in lie after lie when it comes to covid origins and vaccine safety.The CDC continues to lie and deceive the public about mRNA vaccines altering your DNAAs pointed out by The Epoch Times, the CDC’s web page entitled, “Myths and Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines” still asserts the lie about vaccines not altering your DNA, claiming:The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept. Viral vector COVID-19 vaccines deliver genetic material to the cell nucleus to allow our cells to build protection against COVID-19. However, the vector virus does not have the machinery needed to integrate its genetic material into our DNA, so it cannot alter our DNA.It turns out the CDC was lying all along. No one is surprised to learn this, and it begs the obvious question: What else is the CDC lying about? What other truths are they hiding from the public?The CDC lied about vaccine distribution throughout your body, and they lied about vaccines altering your DNA. The CDC, which owns thousands of patents on vaccines, is actually a vaccine criminal cartel and propaganda operation that deliberately misleads the public about vaccines in order to sell deadly poison to the masses.The CDC, in other words, is a pharmaceutical crime cartel that carries out crimes against humanity in order to enrich Big Pharma (and themselves).TheCovidWorld.com has also found that the mRNA code injected into people as part of the covid vaccines contains a gp130 cancer-causing gene sequence. While more research is needed, it appears the mRNA vaccine may actually “program” human DNA to grow cancer tumors.Get the full story in today’s Situation Update podcast below. The vaccine discussion starts at 34:50. Before that, we cover Joe Biden’s Slur of the Union Address and you get to hear me belt out lines from the song, “I Give You My Word” as performed by President Komacho (Terry Crews) in the film Idiocracy … which turns out to be a documentary of the Biden administration.																
35	0	Social media giant Facebook has been running a campaign in collusion with institutions promoting the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines that have already injured or killed millions.An article named the platform founded by Mark Zuckerberg as part of the Alliance for Advancing Health Online (AAHO). Branded as a “multi-year initiative,” AAHO seeks to “advance public understanding of how social media and behavioral sciences can be leveraged to improve the health of communities around the world.”Several entities are also part of AAHO, including the World Bank, the World Health Organization, pharmaceutical company Merck and the CDC Foundation – the latter being independent from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.A June 2021 press release about the alliance said Facebook and Merck have committed $20 million each to AAHO, which is initially set to address “vaccine hesitancy and vaccine equity” among underserved communities. (Related: Facebook relies on Gates-funded W.H.O. to define ‘vaccine misinformation.’)Several White House staffers received an email in June 2021 about AAHO’s formation. These include senior COVID-19 response adviser Becca Siegel and Department of Health and Human Services Director of Digital Engagement Tericka Lambert. White House Presidential Innovation Fellow Georgeta Dragoiu, who is connected with the White House’s COVID-19 Vaccine Public Education Strategy and Media Campaign, also received the email.It is unclear how the White House responded to the email about AAHO. The Epoch Times sent inquiries to the entities involved, such as Facebook’s parent company Meta, the White House press office and the individual recipients. However, it did not receive responses as of writing.Brighteon.TVCDC Foundation Communications Director Amy Tolchinsky, meanwhile, released a written statement about its involvement in AAHO. “While we are not involved in its operations, received any funding for our involvement or provided any funding, our association with AAHO – which was publicly announced in June of 2021 – is a way to educate the public about the safety and efficacy of vaccines to a broader audience,” her statement said.AAHO denounced as government-sponsored propagandaSeveral experts, who were censored by Facebook for refusing to adhere to the medical establishment’s narrative, spoke out against the AAHO, telling the Epoch Times that it is a front for suppressing what authorities consider as misinformation regarding vaccines. Lockdown critic Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said: “[It’s] difficult for me to understand this as anything other than a government propaganda campaign.”Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance President Dr. Pierre Kory said there is no “scientifically-supported public health objective for getting people vaccinated.” According to the doctor, who promotes the use of ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment, he believes Facebook has potentially placed itself in the legal role of “state actor.” Kory added that by promoting vaccines and censoring reports of serious reactions, the social media platform could be held liable for vaccine-related injuries.Meanwhile, mRNA vaccine technology inventor Dr. Robert Malone said: “If Facebook wants to play doctor, then it has to fulfill the professional and ethical obligations of the profession.” This includes disclosing the potential risks of the COVID-19 vaccines.He added that AAHO “poses a direct violation of ethical responsibilities in medicine” – which includes disclosing the dangers of any recommended treatments and any alternative treatment options. A victim of Big Tech censorship himself, Malone was banned from Twitter after raising safety concerns about the shots.Aaron Siri, lawyer for the Informed Consent Action Network, said a tripartite alliance between Big Government, Big Tech and Big Pharma is “by the very least, [a] mammoth campaign” to suppress free speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. He told the Epoch Times: “It creates a dangerous precedent when social media outlets are carrying the government’s message while suppressing messaging that’s contrary to what the government is trying to promote.”																
36	0	Today it was yet another beautiful spring day in Oregon and it appeared that many people were breaking their chains of lockdown in order to drive or walk or even sit on the porch to bide their time.  For the first time in weeks, I did not watch the morning news. I am growing tired of the whole exercise and I am getting tired of the idea that for some reason we are becoming hermits because of an organized effort by the media to tell you that life has risks.  The one particular risk is COVID-19.  Before COVID-19 happened, you went about your lives without thinking about the risks you take. That cigarette you smoke maybe your last – that fourth martini that you have at your three martini lunch could be the very thing that puts you in an accident that can kill you.  That stress you put on your body lifting that garbage can could trigger a massively fatal heart attack – you can go to a routine check up for that headache you have and find out that it is malignant tumor that will end your life prematurely.  The risks are all there, but somehow you tell yourself you have control over these things and maybe doctors can provide direct solutions—COVID-19 is now different.  While there are those who claim to have solutions, there are others who choose to contradict those priceless answers for political reasons. It is unfortunate to say that those who see it as getting worse are becoming the realists and those who chastise the many for being doomsayers are becoming just as annoying because they appear to have no semblance of survival instinct in this brave new world.  Both are right and both are wrong – COVID-19 is the Schrodinger’s Cat of the viral breed.  It is normal to say that the future is affecting the present. Programming so-called future catastrophic events into the minds of the people silences all aspirations and dreams. It shatters the fragile soul and creates apathy for an existence that will have no hope and no savior. Government knows that the way to insure that the future remains frightening is to increase the police state, breathe new life into the criminal mentality, and infuse the zeitgeist with entertainment centered on police brutality, armed conflict, and death.  The government feeds you what is grotesque and some people accept it as sustenance. The consensus that hasn’t awakened is moving closer to an untimely demise. With a plague in the present and a famine on the way we see things deteriorate and we either panic or pay no mind to it.  It is either denial or ignorance.  We use the “economy” as an excuse to not be charitable. Keeping people poor increases, the cannon fodder for a more militant world take over.  The jobless become soldiers and fight a war that looks as if it will not end. The COVID-19 issue will and shall always be open ended .. and here is why.  When COVID-19 claimed its first patient in the United States, it was called the invisible enemy and enemy worthy of declaring war.  Joe Biden said during the democratic debate “We’re at war with a virus” and then came President Trump’s statement “We have to fight that invisible enemy—unknown, but we are getting to know it a lot better.”  Orwell, did a great job of describing how empty words of politicians somehow fill the air but give little of substance to the people when he said: War rhetoric, like all stilted political language, is tailored “to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.  In this case politicians are still giving solidity to wind as like the wind is invisible, so is COVID-19. COVID-19 is the enemy—unlike a terrorist or an assassin or a country it is invisible.  This means that leaders can use an invisible threat at any time to control us.  All they have to do is agree that there is something out there that can kill you, they don’t have to present any evidence of it.  There is a statement that has been passed around in conspiracy theory circles that has been attributed to Henry Kissinger.  “Today Americans would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order; tomorrow they will be grateful. This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by their world government.”  This statement was allegedly made in Evian France On May 21, 1992 at a Bilderberg meeting.  Unbeknownst to Kissinger, his speech was taped by a Swiss delegate to the meeting.  This is what Kissinger knew was going to happen – he just didn’t know when and he probably was wondering who would be diabolical enough to threaten the world with a scorched earth policy in order to bring about a New world order.  The war that has been unleashed has no soldiers in the fight – but there are rookie recruits who went from hand washing to handing over their rights.  Those of us taking responsible measures—canceling engagements, homeschooling children, self-isolation, fearing for the health and well-being of everyone we know and everyone we don’t—are already acting as conscripts in a mass battle of patience and attrition.  How do our would-be commanders envision the war on coronavirus playing out? They appear to not have a plan to pull us out of the war we are in –again this is right out of Orwell’s Playbook:  “The war is not meant to be won. It is meant to be continuous. The essential act of modern warfare is the destruction of the produce of human labor. A hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance. In principle, the war effort is always planned to keep society on the brink of starvation.”  It was John Bolton who dissolved the National Security Council’s global health security team, Trump hired him and then fired him and of course, Trump gets blamed. No one is clear on that because the media would have to attack Bolton, who for some reason became an ally of the media because he was going to expose trump as incompetent during the impeachment proceedings.  Many times I have discussed how Bolton and several other men in government had a plan to change this country with a manifesto that they wrote called The Project for the New American Century: Rebuilding America’s Defense.  Under the Chairmanship of William Kristol, the same William Kristol who lead the charge to impeach President Trump, and co-authored by John Bolton, Richard Perle, Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, Elliot Abrams, and Donald Rumsfeld, Rebuilding America’s Defenses stated that to “further the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one-absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event- like a new Pearl Harbor”. Going further to describe its Hobbesian agenda, the cabal stated that “the Cold War was a bipolar world; the 21st century world is- for the moment at least- decidedly unipolar with America as the world’s sole superpower”.  While much has been said about the “inside job” of 9/11, a lesser appreciated terrorist act occurred over several weeks beginning on September 18, 2001 killing five and infective 17 in the form of envelopes laced with bio-weaponized anthrax.  This anthrax attack led quickly into the 2004 Bioshield Act with a $5 billion budget and mandate to “pre-empt and defend further bioweapon attacks”. This new chapter of the revolution in military affairs was to be coordinated from leading bioweapons facility at the Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick. Since 2002, over $50 billion has been spent on Bioweapons research and defense to date.  The earlier October 2000 The Rebuilding Americas Defenses document emphasized the importance which the neocon cabal placed on bioweapons and other next generation war tech stating:  “Combat will likely take place in new dimensions: In space, cyber-space and perhaps the world of microbes… advanced forms of biological warfare that can “target” specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool”.  This would indicate that both 9/11 and the COVID-19 pandemic would be sufficient enough to transform America into a military gulag. As we can also see they also have plans for the internet and what may be out there in space.  Where Hitler used the burning of the Reichstag to justify his enabling Acts, the neocons had their 9/11. The difference in the case of America was that Cheney failed to achieve the same level of absolute control over his nation as Hitler captured by 1934.  We have seen a transformation that has taken 20 years to achieve now with the “enemy” being invisible gives those in power control over the psychological well-being of the country. Declaring war on the invisible enemy is a motivator to push an Orwellian dystopia on the American people.  Biden and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo have suggested mobilizing the military to build tent health facilities or repurpose base installations as care centers; Cuomo also suggested he be given control of the Army Corps of Engineers. The military has had to push back by reminding politicians that its medical and logistical assets are geared toward treatment of mass casualties, not limitation of viral contagion.  The Pentagon has already begun to contend with coronavirus cases among ships’ crews and in barracks, as well as the recently gained knowledge that its most hardened nuclear-proof bunkers can’t protect against simple viruses. The Department of Defense is ready, willing and able to support civilian authorities to the greatest extent possible.  The evidence is the train cars transporting military ordinance through cities, d-mort tents and the visual of mass graves in order to give that war edge to everything. It can be argued that these images are unnecessary but they certainly send the message to the minds of the people that this is a war – a war against an enemy as invisible as the wind.  The unfortunate thing is that this invisible enemy we are hearing about and the war that has been waged appears to be open ended.  Sometimes, this will be to urge public complacency when the government seeks to conceal its own incompetence. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar refused to answer questions on Sunday about how many ventilators—the key determinant in how many Covid-19 victims will live or die—the United States had on hand, calling it a “national security” issue. (Trump, meanwhile, has advised the nation’s governors looking for respirators and ventilators to “try getting it yourselves.”  But like a war, the coronavirus pandemic is likely to inflict far more casualties than we normally count. It has taken months to get a seeming majority of Americans to take seriously the possibility that their behavior means life or death for friends, loved ones, and strangers who are susceptible to the virus’s direct effects.  But virtually no one is focused on the cascade of depression, and death that will come as indirect effects of the virus’s progress: patients with other afflictions who will die as Covid-19 victims take up ICU space, equipment, and personnel; healthy delivery drivers who fall asleep at the wheel covering shifts for a sick colleague or picking up extra work to cover a shortfall at home.  Rather than lay out an achievable but ambitious long-term goal to protect Americans, we are again the victims as there are among us leaders willing to abuse their power by taking advantage of the fear that they themselves generated.  Meanwhile the media does not question the party as it is evident that rather than having state television we are now watching Deep State television where the opposition is controlled with bleach blonde and well-groomed talking heads praising Trump –while younger virtue signaling hypocrites attack everything that comes out of his mouth.  As history unfolds it becomes quite clear that our interpretation of news events is based on quick glances at a newspaper, magazine or news program that is funded, owned and/or operated by a corporation that has a controlling political interest in what is being reported. This type of journalism is what you would expect in a country where the press is no longer objective. It usually turns up in countries that are highly controlled.  Countries with state-run newspapers and state-run radio and TV stations. The state of the media has been declared dead by old-timers who long for the days of real journalism, where hunting for the blockbuster story was as stimulating as delivering it. Now those days have long passed and no one understands that sometimes it takes more than a television show or a newspaper columnist to get the whole story.  While trying to keep pace with an ever-changing world there is a point where we have difficulty keeping informed of what dangers are out there that might harm our families and ourselves.  So we develop a need for instant information. A flip of the switch gets us a news report. We listen and watch for certain buzzwords or sound bites. If we do not hear anything that sounds dangerous to us or if it does not affect us directly we tend to overlook it, or ignore it.  There are times where we have neglected information that may come back and bite us in the future.  That information, of course, is history, and while some of us were nerds and paid attention to it, there were others who felt that anything dealing with history would have no bearing on our lives in the future.  This can be looked at as progressive thinking, or living life deliberately. In these ever-changing times, it becomes necessary to go back in history a bit and see how people then reacted to some of the same things that are plaguing us now.  America has become utterly intolerant of uncertainty. And in the absence of certainty, Americans scan the news, see the confusing stories, try to work on pattern seeking skills, and connect the dots.  From there come the best conspiracy theories.  The biggest conspiracy theory is about the 5G connections to COVID-19. While there are circumstances that show that 5-G certainly effects the immune systems of those who are directly exposed. The various conspiracy theories about it starting COVID-19 lack complexity and components of nanotechnology need to be included in the research as COVID-19 is more than a virus – it appears to also be a very advanced technology that also binds nanotech with biological sequencing.  One of the other most vital things that have been over looked in the conspiracy theory is that in the aftermath of COVID-19 there will be an upsurge in demand for 5G in order to effectively usher in the new normal of an advanced surveillance state.  Broadband network demand will be over the top now that companies will need to effectively enforce stay at home policies.  Moreover, is the coronavirus outbreak and the “social distancing″ required to mitigate the spread going to become the business case for more advanced and robust 5G technologies for a future in which business, health care and human interaction must be at more than an arm’s length?  The jury is still out on whether home broadband, which tends to have lower capacity than more robust business networks, will be able to handle the traffic as whole neighborhoods become Wi-Fi hotbeds as adults video conference with their co-workers and their teens stream videos in between checking Blackboard for assignments. Providers, including AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast, are facing a test of whether they’ll be able to handle the increased demand.  Even though we know that this forced shutdown is temporary, those pushing the 5G upgrade will certainly capitalize on the what if scenarios and how to cut business overhead by encouraging telecommuting.  But that of course is not all.  Google has announced that it is partnering with dozens of governments around the world, sharing its users’ location history, and, in the process, giving us an insight into how much Google has control over us and knows about us.  For example, location data gleaned from smartphones shows that there are now 85 percent fewer trips to grocery or pharmacy stores in Italy, compared to early February, before the coronavirus struck the country. Italy went on extensive lockdown, and Google’s data shows it. Retail and recreation visits are down 94 percent, trips to parks are down 90 percent, transit stations 87 percent.  The country’s infection curve appears to finally be flattening. In contrast, American retail and recreation visits are only down 47 percent, grocery and pharmacy visits 22 percent, parks 19 percent and transit stations 51 percent, suggesting American people are not staying at home nearly enough to stop the spread of this virus.  Google insists that its new policy will not breach users’ privacy, promising to “adhere to their stringent privacy protocols and protecting people’s privacy. No personally identifiable information,” it claims “will be made available at any point.”  This is not at all reassuring.  Google’s move is merely the latest in a long line linking big tech companies ever more closely with the government and the security state.  Technology allows for the monitoring of individuals to better regulate stay at home orders. However, this opens up new possibilities for authoritarian regimes. Israelis who violate quarantining are now subject to up to seven years in prison, and location data could be used against individuals.  It would be something to be sent to jail because your phone ratted on you talking a walk. Furthermore, given the country’s history of racist law enforcement, the law has the potential for serious abuse.  You don’t need an outrageous conspiracy theory to demonize 5G – 5G not only will harm your health – but it will be used by big brother to keep you under surveillance.  This is the new automated tyranny.  It would be something to be sent to jail because your phone ratted on you talking a walk. Furthermore, given the country’s history of racist law enforcement, the law has the potential for serious abuse.  Google’s move is merely the latest in a long line linking big tech companies ever more closely with the government and the security state.  For a hint of what’s in store, you can look to China—our role model for all things dystopian—where the contagion started.  In an attempt to fight the epidemic, the government has given its surveillance state apparatus—which boasts the most expansive and sophisticated surveillance system in the world—free rein. Thermal scanners using artificial intelligence (AI) have been installed at train stations in major cities to assess body temperatures and identify anyone with a fever. Facial recognition cameras and cell phone carriers track people’s movements constantly, reporting in real time to data centers that can be accessed by government agents and employers alike. And coded color alerts (red, yellow and green) sort people into health categories that correspond to the amount of freedom of movement they’re allowed: “Green code, travel freely. Red or yellow, report immediately.”  Mind you, prior to the coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese surveillance state had already been hard at work tracking its citizens through the use of some 200 million security cameras installed nationwide. Equipped with facial recognition technology, the cameras allow authorities to track so-called criminal acts, such as jaywalking, which factor into a person’s social credit score.  Social media credit scores assigned to Chinese individuals and businesses categorize them on whether or not they are “good” citizens. A real-name system—which requires people to use government-issued ID cards to buy mobile sims, obtain social media accounts, take a train, board a plane, or even buy groceries—coupled with social media credit scores ensures that those blacklisted as “unworthy” are banned from accessing financial markets, buying real estate or travelling by air or train. Among the activities that can get you labeled unworthy are taking reserved seats on trains or causing trouble in hospitals.  That same social credit score technology used to identify, track and segregate citizens is now one of China’s chief weapons in its fight to contain the coronavirus from spreading. However, it is far from infallible and a prime example of the difficulties involved in navigating an autonomous system where disembodied AI systems call the shots. For instance, one woman, who has no symptoms of the virus but was assigned a red code based on a visit to her hometown, has been blocked from returning to her home and job until her color code changes. She has been stuck in this state of limbo for weeks with no means of challenging the color code or knowing exactly why she’s been assigned a red code.  Fighting the coronavirus epidemic has given China the perfect excuse for unleashing the full force of its surveillance and data collection powers. The problem, as Eamon Barrett acknowledges in Fortune magazine, is what happens after: “Once the outbreak is controlled, it’s unclear whether the government will retract its new powers.”  The lesson for the ages: once any government is allowed to expand its powers, it’s almost impossible to pull back.																
37	0	A naval officer has been relieved of his position on a destroyer over his refusal to get the COVID-19 vaccine.  On Friday, a Navy spokesman announced that Cmdr. Lucian Kins had been removed as executive officer of the USS Winston Churchill for “failing to abide by lawful order,” according to USNI News.  “On December 10, 2021, Commander, Naval Surface Squadron 14, Capt. Ken Anderson, relieved Cmdr. Lucian Kins as executive officer of USS Winston S. Churchill (DDG 81) due to loss of confidence in Kins’ ability to perform his duties,” Lt. Cmdr. Jason Fischer said in a statement.  Another Navy source said the move was due to Kins’ refusal to receive the vaccine or submit to COVID-19 testing. Kins applied for a religious exemption but was refused by the Navy, Fox News reported.  The ship’s plans and tactics officer, Lt. Cmdr. Han Yi, will take over as executive officer until a replacement is named. Kins has been reassigned to squadron staff.  Trending: Biden: Everybody Knows Someone Whose Friend Has Taken Naked Pictures of Them and Blackmailed Them In August, the Pentagon announced that the COVID-19 vaccine would be mandatory for all members of the U.S. military. The Navy required all active duty and reserve sailors to be fully vaccinated by Nov. 28.  As Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Friday, each branch is responsible for the logistics of enforcing the mandate.  “Those sorts of actions are not being handled centrally by the department at this level,” he said. “The service secretaries and the service chiefs are in charge of the way they are implementing the mandatory vaccine requirements.”  Are COVID-19 vaccine mandates unconstitutional? Yes No Enter your email   Completing this poll entitles you to The Western Journal news updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. As for the service members who are fully vaccinated, it might not be long before they’re subject to a new round of required jabs. Kirby said the Pentagon is hashing out whether to go ahead and require COVID-19 vaccine booster shots.  “There are active discussions here in the department at the policy level about booster shots and whether or not to make those mandatory,” he said, according to The Epoch Times. “There have been no final decisions made about that.”  According to Navy data, 5,731 sailors have yet to satisfy the original requirement.  The Times reported that while 2,705 active-duty sailors have put in requests for religious exemptions from the mandate, none have been approved. The Navy has, however, signed off on “seven medical exemptions, 326 temporary medical exemptions, and 124 administrative exemptions.”  The brave members of our armed forces do not sign on to protect their country without understanding the tremendous personal risks that come with it.  As health reporter Alex Berenson has noted, it’s pretty remarkable that the first responders who worked all throughout the pandemic are refusing the vaccine at particularly high rates.  Related: Developing: The Real Threat from the Ukraine War Has Nothing to Do with Russia Police officers, nurses, firefighters and EMTs probably understand risk better than the average person; the same can be said of the men and women of our military who dedicate their lives to defending their countrymen.  What’s more, is it safe for our nation to threaten so many service members with expulsion to combat a virus that has proved considerably less dangerous to young, healthy individuals?  At what point are we sacrificing national security for the sake of the vaccine? Is the virus really more deadly than depleting our own armed forces?  We should not be violating the medical autonomy of these thousands of Americans — to say nothing of the constitutional rights they have taken an oath to protect, even at the cost of their own lives!  This mandate is a disgrace to everything our nation stands for and the very flag the armed forces fight to defend.																
38	0	Telecommunications megacorporations are poised to launch their “upgraded” 5G networks in the United States this January. This is despite the fact that there is plenty of evidence that such a rollout would lead to catastrophe and deaths, especially among Americans who are fully vaccinated against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).  Sean, the host of SGT Report’s online show, pointed out that there is evidence of 5G towers emitting some kind of electromagnetic waves that directly attack people’s bodies. As evidence, he provided a video released to the public by La Quinta Columna.  La Quinta Columna, a Spanish-language media outlet, is notable for being one of the first independent outlets to report that the COVID-19 vaccines contain the toxic substance graphene oxide. (Related: Study: 5G exposure a “significant factor” in higher covid cases, deaths.)  The Spanish media outlet played a short clip on one of its recent livestreams of a man who parks his bike right next to a 5G tower for a few seconds and then suddenly collapsing out of nowhere. Ricardo Delgado Martin, founder of La Quinta Columna and host of the media outlet’s show, pointed out that the CCTV camera that captured the man’s sudden collapse experienced a glitch in its video feed less than a second before the incident occurred.  Delgado speculates that this glitch is what triggered the man’s collapse, and that it was caused by the 5G tower right next to him. Dr. Jose Luis Sevillano, a guest of Delgado, pointed out that this is clear evidence that the 5G towers emit some kind of pulse that directly affects people’s health.  “This is the proof,” said Luis, in Spanish. “Because it’s no longer a matter of the guy falling over from something internal to him, but there’s an external trigger that’s caught on camera… That would explain why so many people are suddenly dropping dead here and there right now.”  “It looks like a gunshot, but it’s an electromagnetic pulse at the speed of light,” said Delgado. “And it’s being recorded by the camera as glitching, which is normal.”  Sean does not believe the glitch was a coincidence. “The glitch in the video suggests some sort of, maybe electromagnetic pulse or energy weapon, may have been used in murdering that man.”  COVID-19 vaccines could make people more susceptible to 5G Delgado and Luis are concerned that people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 may be more susceptible to these electromagnetic pulse attacks because their bodies contain graphene oxide.  In July 2021, Spanish researchers from the University of Almeria discovered that almost all of the Pfizer vaccine is nothing but graphene oxide. This magnetic substance, when injected into a person’s system, can cause deadly health complications including liver and kidney damage, spur on the formation of granulomas in the lungs and even trigger pre-programmed cell death.  “If the person [in the video] is vaccinated and has graphene already located in the heart and if, in addition, the person is exercising, well, it’s impossible to be clearer,” said Delgado, pointing out that the graphene most likely contributed to the man’s demise.  “That was a pulse multiplied by graphene,” remarked Luis. He added that he has received more reports from patients of heart palpitations “because of the density” in the 5G waves. Many of those patients have also reported feeling a strange sensation in the environment whenever they step outside.  “As if they were in a spaceship,” said Luis. “Or that they went out to a planet that is not ours.” He said this feeling is due to the electromagnetic fields in the air caused by nearby 5G towers.  This strange sensation when going outside is the least of their problems. Luis remarked that, if the electromagnetic fields ever pulsed like how it did in the video, it can create a disaster for people nearby.  “What works [in the body] stops doing so … you lose consciousness,” said Luis. “Some people recover and say, ‘What the heck happened to me?’ But in some people, the process is so fast that they don’t recover again. They end up in cardiorespiratory arrest, and it’s over.”  If the person who was hit by the 5G tower’s electromagnetic pulse had graphene in his or her system because of the COVID-19 vaccine, that person becomes significantly less likely to shrug off an electromagnetic pulse.																
39	0	The vaccines are bad news. Fifteen bodies were examined (all died from 7 days to 6 months after vaccination; ages 28 to 95). The coroner or the public prosecutor didn’t associate the vaccine as the cause of death in any of the cases. However, further examination revealed that the vaccine was implicated in the deaths of 14 of the 15 cases. The most attacked organ was the heart (in all of the people who died), but other organs were attacked as well. The implications are potentially enormous resulting in millions of deaths. The vaccines should be immediately halted.  No need to worry. It is doubtful that anything will happen because the work wasn’t published in a peer-reviewed journal so will be ignored by the scientific community. That’s just the way it works.  The paper I got an email recently from Mike Yeadon, former VP of Pfizer, who urged me to check out this video. He wrote me this email on 12/24/21:  https://www.bitchute.com/video/fHIT55iM4Zv9/  Steve,  This is about the worst 15min I’ve ever seen.  Mass covid19 vaccination is leading to mass murder.  Mike   The video references this paper, posted on December 10, 2021, On COVID vaccines: why they cannot work, and irrefutable evidence of their causative role in deaths after vaccination by Sucharit Bhakdi, MD and Arne Burkhardt, MD. It has been getting a lot of attention lately.  Check out the number of likes and retweets… just in the first 3 hours!!!!   The authors did an autopsy in 15 patients who died (from 7 days to 6 months) after receiving the COVID vaccine. These were all cases where the coroner ruled as NOT being caused by the vaccine.  They discovered that in 14 of the 15 patients there was widespread evidence of the body attacking itself, something that is never seen before. The heart was attacked in all 14 cases.  A number of salient aspects dominated in all affected tissues of all cases:  inflammatory events in small blood vessels (endotheliitis), characterized by an abundance of T-lymphocytes and sequestered, dead endothelial cells within the vessel lumen;  the extensive perivascular accumulation of T-lymphocytes;  a massive lymphocytic infiltration of surrounding non-lymphatic organs or tissue with T-lymphocytes.  Lymphocytic infiltration occasionally occurred in combination with intense lymphocytic activation and follicle formation. Where these were present, they were usually accompanied by tissue destruction.  Here's the video presentation of the results.  VAERS as well as other independent studies (e.g., see this vaccine injury paper) shows the vaccines are killing people and that cardiac events were highly elevated. This study is consistent with those results.  This work independently validates the analysis of Peter Schimacher who showed a minimum of 30% to 40% of the deaths after vaccine were caused by the vaccine.  Reactions from a level-headed scientist (name withheld to protect him from attack) If the autopsy findings are confirmed by other pathologists with additional samples, and if they are combined with the findings of Dr. Hoffe (>60% inoculant recipients have elevated D-dimer tests and evidence of clotting) and Dr. Cole (increase in cancers after inoculation, including twenty-fold increase in uterine cancer), we are seeing a disaster of unimaginable proportions.  The conclusion (if supported by further data) is that essentially EVERY inoculant recipient suffers damage, with more damage after each shot.  Given the seriousness of the types of damage (autoimmune diseases, cancer, re-emergent dormant infections, clotting/strokes, cardiac damage, etc.), these effects will translate into lifespan reduction, which should be counted as deaths from the inoculations.  So, in the USA, where ~200M people have been fully inoculated, the number of deaths will not be the 10,000 or so reported in VAERS, or the 150,000+ scaled-up deaths from VAERS, but could be closer to tens of millions when the inoculation effects play out!  What the above three findings (Burkhart, Hoffe, Cole, and I suspect many others who have not yet come forward) show is that the post-inoculation effects are not rare events (as reported by the media-gov't), but are in actuality frequent events.  They may be, in fact, universal, with the severity and damage different for each recipient.   The question in my mind is whether it is possible to reverse these inoculation-based adverse events.  Can the innate immune system be fully restored?  Can the micro clotting be reversed?  Can the autoimmunity be reversed?  I have seen a wide spectrum of opinions on whether this is possible, none of which is overly convincing.   Are we headed for the situation where the ~30% unvaxxed will be devoting their lives to operating whatever is left of the economic infrastructure and serving as caretakers for the vaxxed?  I realize the above sounds extreme, and maybe when more data are gathered from myriad credible sources the results and conclusions may change, but right now the above data seem to synchronize with the demonstrated underlying mechanisms of damage.  Additionally, we seem to be doubling down on inoculations, with fourth booster being proposed for Israel, and UK suggesting quarterly boosters.

40	0	In locked down New Zealand, there have been more recorded Covid-19 “vaccine” deaths than Covid deaths based on the latest numbers. Their tracking system indicates 40 people have reportedly died as a result of the vaccines while 27 have died from Covid itself.  Journalist Elijah Schaffer carefully shared these numbers on Twitter. A recent crackdown on “anti-vaxx” statistics and commentary likely prompted Schaffer’s use of phrases like “possibly related” and “in theory.” Many who have made similar statements without the qualifiers have been swiftly banned by Big Tech sites.  SHOCKING: New Zealand reported 27 total deaths “with” COVID-19 & 40 deaths possibly related to the Pfizer vaccine since 2020  This week they reported 0 C19 deaths & 3 deaths possibly related to the vaccine  Making the vaccine more deadly in theory to NZ’ers than the actual virus pic.twitter.com/Om3OrVe7cs  — ELIJAH SCHAFFER (@ElijahSchaffer) September 15, 2021  Both numbers are relatively low compared to other nations of similar size, but here’s the thing. Covid-19 deaths are invariably inflated in most countries while vaccine death numbers are always underreported. It’s not clear if New Zealand is inflating their Covid death numbers because there simply isn’t very much data to examine, but it’s certain the vaccine death numbers are much, much higher.  First and foremost, vaccine adverse reactions are universally underreported. It behooves doctors to find other reasons for their patients to have died since the vast majority of them are pushing the vaccines tenaciously. Second, most grieving families do not report the deaths to the databases. Estimates range from 1%-10% of actual deaths that are both attributed to the vaccines and then proactively reported.  In other words, even if some of the deaths reported in New Zealand turned out to be false or inaccurate, it’s a certainty that there are degrees of magnitude more people who died from the vaccines and were never reported as such.  ***Support The Liberty Daily and Mike Lindell -- use code TLD at MyPillow.com and get up to 66% off!*** New Zealand is the outlier. They’re the odd ones on the opposite side of the scale from Sweden as they have perpetuated the most draconian lockdowns in the world due to their “Covid Zero” stance. As a result, they have enjoyed a very low number of Covid-19 attributed deaths while completely ignoring the toll their lockdowns are having on the people. We may never know how many suicides, drug overdoses, murders, and other avoidable deaths were caused by their “Covid Zero” policy because such information is kept secret.  For a disease with a 99.93% recovery rate among people under 40, the extreme lockdown and vaccination pushes being implemented by governments like New Zealand are ludicrous and doing far more damage than the disease itself.																
41	0	The Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines are mass murder weapons, deadlier than guns, cannons and tanks combined.  This surfaced after an analysis of figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database revealed that 61,000 people, supposedly in the prime of their life, ages 25-44, died of vaccine-related causes in the U.S. in the fall and winter of 2021.  Edward Dowd, a former BlackRock portfolio manager, made the appalling revelation during the March 10 episode of “The Alex Jones Show.”  According to Dowd, an investment adviser on Wall Street, an insurance industry expert who is part of his team stumbled upon the buried truth when, looking for something else, he broke down the CDC figures by age and created his own baseline death rates from there.  Showing charts the actuarian plotted from the figures, Dowd pointed at chart four as the punch line.  “Basically, you see that millennials experienced 84 percent excess death in the fall and winter of 2021. So excess deaths accelerated when mandates and boosters hit,” Dowd told Jones.  “And this age group is important because they’re healthy. And you can’t say that they, you know, miss their cancer screenings. This is ages 25 to 44. So this is just devastating evidence that the vaccines are causing this age group to die at an accelerating rate. (Related: Life insurance companies sound DEATH ALERT warnings over nearly 100,000 excess deaths per month happening right now in the USA.)  “I know I showed percentages in that chart, but the actual bodies are 61,000. That’s the Vietnam War event that just occurred to the millennial generation – 58,000 died in the Vietnam War.”  Dowd said he’s certain the vaccines are the culprits because the acceleration started in the summer when the mandates started hitting in August and September last year.  “And then [President Joe] Biden came out [announcing the mandates]. And boosters were also authorized and started happening. So let’s call this what it is. This is death by government mandate or democide, death by government. That’s what’s going on here.”  The insurance companies have pointed at the alarming spike in vaccine-related deaths before, but the government refused to heed the warning and proceeded with the mass injections.  Dowd could only speculate on why the “pyschos” in government did this.  “Well, there’s two ways to look at this. Just good old-fashioned power and greed, or there was a plan hatched by some very evil people. I’m going with power and greed for now. But you know, as we roll through this very active fraud, it’s being exposed. There’s more and more evidence coming to the front that this is part of some sort of bigger grand plan.”  Dowd’s suspicion grew after noticing that what’s happening in the U.S. is being replicated by other global governments that have mandated the vaccines.  Government’s war on people “So this is a worldwide tragedy. And it’s a war. And whether the government knew it was a war on people, they’re currently at war on their own people. And it’s the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”  Dowd related that a board member of a German insurer approached him two weeks ago and revealed their government was underreporting vaccine-related injuries by a factor of 25 to one. That is based on approximately three million Germans, or 3.6 percent of the total population, who were injured by vaccines enough to seek medical treatment.  No wonder, Dowd is leaning toward the grand plan scheme now.  That’s why his team is going to drop more charts, all interpreting the CDC data, until the true reason why there were more deaths in 2021 than 2020 is exposed.																
42	0	The dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima stands as one of the most heinous crimes against humanity ever committed. It was carried by the United States government, using a weapon of mass destruction against a civilian population consisting primarily of women and children. According to historical records, 135,000 people were killed by that bomb, with roughly half that many killed by the second bomb dropped on Nagasaki.  Historians and observers can argue over the “merit” of such an act, as it was largely credited with ending World War II in the Pacific, but no one can argue that mass civilian casualties were deliberately inflicted by the bombing. These were not accidental “collateral damage” deaths; they were inflicted by design. The bomb targeted a city populated almost entirely by civilians. This was a deliberate, indiscriminate act of mass murder.  Importantly, this event proved that the United States government is willing to commit mass killings of targeted ethnic groups to achieve its strategic goals. Years later, the US government dropped nuclear weapons on the Bikini Atoll (Marshall Islands), murdering an entire ecosystem and killing countless Pacific islanders with radiation poisoning.  Thus, anyone dismissing the idea that the government is now mass murdering its own citizens with “vaccine” bioweapons injections has no clue what horrors the US government is capable of committing against humanity.  Now the US military is targeting its own personnel for a bioweapons “nuke” hidden in covid vaccines While the atomic bomb was directed at a strategic enemy (Japan) which had carried out its own heinous crimes against humanity — the murder and rape of innocent Chinese civilians during the war, for example — today the Pentagon is now “nuking” its own personnel by mandating bioweapons spike protein injections of nearly two million active duty U.S. troops. (That number spans all the branches of active military service.) With a post-vaccine death rate of just 25% — which seems to be on the low side of estimates from the medical experts I’ve interviewed — we’d be looking at half a million active duty U.S. soldiers being killed by covid vaccines over the next few years as the vascular damage and Antibody Dependent Enhancement effects kick in.  That number — 500,000 — dwarfs the casualties of Hiroshima.  It makes you wonder: Which military leaders could be so stupid as to subject the entire military to an unproven, deadly, experimental injection consisting of a cocktail of biological weapons and viral fragments? The answer is obvious: This is all about decimating the national defense of the United States of America through the mass murder of US active duty troops, making way for the planned UN occupation and overthrow of the USA.  The war that the Pentagon once waged against the Japanese empire has now been turned against the American people, and we are no safer than those who lived in Hiroshima on that fateful day.  There are already hundreds of thousands of vaccine deaths among innocent civilians The anti-human vaccine zealots aren’t merely targeting US active duty military personnel; they’re also targeting the world population at large… civilians, women, children, elderly and everyone. The covid “vaccine” is the ultimate weapon of mass destruction, killing indiscriminately, destroying human tissue and causing cellular destruction, suffering and death in anyone unlucky enough to be injected with it.  According to VAERS data, over 12,200 post-vaccine deaths have so far been reported in the United States alone. Knowing that VAERS data are far behind schedule (many weeks) and that the VAERS database only represents anywhere from 1/10th to 1/100th of the actual deaths that have occurred. Realistically, we are most likely looking at several hundred thousand covid vaccine deaths in the United States to date, far exceeding the number of people killed at Hiroshima.  Note that nothing in this message should be interpreted as making light of the Hiroshima nuclear holocaust event which I consider to be a genocidal, ethnically-targeted crime against humanity. The internment of Japanese Americans in U.S.-based concentration camps is yet another crime against people of Japanese descent, and it proves again that the United States government is ready and willing to throw its own citizens into concentration camps in order to achieve its own strategic aims.  Remember this: If the US government was willing to throw people into war-time concentration camps based on the color of their skin, it is also willing to throw people into covid camps based on the status of their vaccine passports.  The government has not matured or found morality in the 80 years since that war, and if anything, the federal government is now more tyrannical, more dangerous and more drunk on power than at any time in US history. If anything, the federal government now appears to resemble the enforcement arm of an organized crime / racketeering operation run by anti-human globalists and Big Pharma.  Fauci’s NIH funded the ethnically-targeted organ harvesting from living human babies… all in the name of “science” If you’re not convinced of how evil this regime really is, consider the shocking, horrifying fact that the US government funded organ harvesting from aborted (but living) babies who were targeted based on their skin color. This shocking truth was uncovered and confirmed last week by the Washington Free Beacon in this story: Government-Funded Researchers Sought Aborted Minorities for Organ Harvesting.  Reading that story tells you everything you need to know about how the federal government will really treat you when it comes to the pandemic and vaccines:  The federal government gave at least $2.7 million in taxpayer money to researchers who sought out minority babies who had been aborted in order to harvest their organs, according to internal documents released Tuesday.  The University of Pittsburgh targeted minorities in its request for infant organs—including those taken from full-term babies—to create a “pipeline” for fetal research. Researchers said they needed 50 percent of the donated fetuses to be minorities and specified that 25 percent must come from black women. The Pittsburgh metropolitan area is 85 percent white and 8 percent black. Researchers stressed the importance of maintaining organ blood flow in the request, which watchdogs say could violate federal law by asking doctors to illegally preserve organs during labor-inducing abortions.  In other words, the NIH harvested organs from living black babies in order to provide tissue samples for the biotech and vaccine industries. Some of the babies were up to 42 weeks old, which means they were old enough to survive outside the womb.  This was all done under Fauci and the NIH, by the way, the same group that funded gain-of-function experiments in Wuhan to build the toxic spike protein nanoparticle that has been inserted into the vaccines to mass murder humanity.  The NIH is an enterprise of murder.  And these deadly covid “vaccines,” much like nuclear weapons, are indiscriminate killers that are being deployed against humanity for the express purpose of causing maximum casualties. All the people involved in this pursuit of mass death are, themselves, complicit in mass murder. And they have the full backing of Big Tech, Big Media, Big Government, Big Pharma and all the other anti-human institutions that are now waging outright war against the human race on a global scale.  What they did to Hiroshima in the 1940s is now being done to the entire world in 2021. May God help us all.																
43	0	The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently released a document proving that Pfizer’s Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) mRNA vaccine can cause nearly 1,300 adverse events.  The FDA was recently embroiled in a court case over how quickly it can release documents from its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research regarding Pfizer’s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The relevant documents contain valuable information about Pfizer’s trials and the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.  The agency wanted the data to be released very slowly over the next 75 years by releasing only 500 pages worth of documents every month. But U.S. District Judge Mark T. Pittman ordered the FDA to release 55,000 pages worth of documents each month starting March 1.  This would allow the public to have all of the FDA’s information regarding Pfizer’s vaccine within eight months. (Related: Leaked top-secret Pfizer document shows COVID-19 vaccine is FAR MORE DANGEROUS than the world knows.)  Among the documents the FDA was forced to release just days ago is a 38-page report titled “5.3.6 Cumulative Analysis of Post-Authorization Adverse Event Reports of PF-07302048 (BNT162B2) Received Through 28-Feb-2021.”  This document, which was marked by Pfizer as “proprietary and confidential,” and warned of possible legal action if released without the Big Pharma company’s consent, goes into detail regarding how many people have experienced adverse events after taking the company’s experimental mRNA vaccine.  The document has an appendix that is nine pages long and lists 1,291 different adverse events associated with the company’s COVID-19 vaccine.  This extremely lengthy list has a whole host of different medical conditions that the Pfizer vaccine can cause, including acute kidney injury, neonatal death, deep vein thrombosis, epileptic psychosis, facial paralysis, liver injury, stillbirth, temporal lobe epilepsy, type 1 diabetes and vertebral artery thrombosis.  Vaccines must be recalled and Pfizer held accountable Mary Holland, president and general counsel for the health freedom and anti-vaccine mandate organization Children’s Health Defense, called the Pfizer document with the nearly 1,300 adverse events list a “bombshell.”  “These findings should put an immediate end to the Pfizer COVID vaccines,” she said. “The potential for serious harm is very clear, and those injured by the vaccines are prohibited from suing Pfizer for damages.  She added that this long list of adverse events makes it clear why both the FDA and Pfizer “wanted to keep this data under wraps for 75 years.”  Holland added that the rollout of Pfizer vaccines must be immediately halted before the mass vaccination of children under five years of age starts. The government has already purchased 50 million dollars of this experimental and deadly vaccine for children and infants in this age group, to be delivered by April 30.  She pointed out the risk of serious injury or death from COVID-19 to healthy children within this age group is practically zero and that evidence shows the vaccine is not effective when used in very young children.  “It would be criminal to expose infants and young children to this extremely risky product,” added Holland. “[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System] data shows the catastrophic health impacts the vaccine is having on millions of people, yet Pfizer and other vaccine makers are raking in billions of dollars with no fear of being held accountable for injuries and deaths from their vaccines.”  More related stories: FDA wants to release Pfizer vaccine documents slowly while attention is focused away from pandemic.

44	0	Children in Florida will not be forced or even pressured to get “vaccinated” for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19), Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo has revealed.  At a recent round table event, Ladapo explained that he and Gov. Ron DeSantis are not in favor of the “vaccinate everything that moves” narrative, which is why they decided to make Florida the first state in the country to not recommend jabs for kids.  “According to @FLSurgeonGen, Florida will become the first state to recommend against the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children,” tweeted Karol Markowicz from the New York Post.  Throughout the plandemic, less than 1,000 children died from “covid,” it is important to note. And even these 1,000 “cases” are questionable due to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has never actually been isolated or proven to exist, and the “tests” for it are fraudulent.  “There are 75 million children aged 0-18 in the United States,” notes Red State. “Further, when you drill down, almost all the children that have died from COVID-19 also had pre-existing conditions.”  All things considered, it is simply bad science to suggest that young people take an experimental gene therapy cocktail that could seriously injure or kill them, especially since kids have a zero percent chance of dying from covid.  “… at no point in our history have we as a society chosen to blanket-vaccinate children from a virus that presents such a minuscule, almost non-existent risk to them,” Red State reports.  “Public policy should never be decided by emotion, and it is nothing but an emotional response to vaccinate a six-year-old from COVID-19 who is otherwise healthy. It simply makes no sense, especially in light of the lack of longitudinal data on how the vaccines affect a developing child.”  Jabbing healthy children is deranged DeSantis will surely be labeled an “anti-vaxxer” for this move, which will also upset what Red State‘s “Bonchie” describes as “triple-vaxxed hypochondriacs who believe schools are a vector for transmission to adults.”  There is zero data to suggest children at schools are transmitting anything other than their presence, but the Branch Covidians are not satisfied with this. They want every human body fully jabbed no matter what, and DeSantis is getting in the way of that.  “DeSantis and [Ladapo] should be commended for tuning out the noise and doing what makes sense,” Bonchie writes. “That’s been Florida’s path through the pandemic since the beginning.”  Natural immunity still stands as the best immunity, especially in children. No “vaccine” can ever compare to what the human body is capable of doing all by itself, just so long as it remains unvaccinated.  “Why is it hard for the CDC to understand that the shot is an immunity booster and healthy kids have fabulous immunity?” asked a commenter. “Perhaps the old saying applies: It is difficult for someone to understand something when their job depends on them not understating it.”  Another person pointed out that the war going on in this country over the plandemic is not so much about “left” versus “right,” but is rather about people who use their brains and empirical facts to form beliefs versus drones who let the media and the government do all of their thinking for them.  “The second group does not attempt to extricate the empirical facts from all available information sources and so are followers of the government / legacy media version of the truth,” this same person says.  “I’d like to see the number of kids under the age of 18 that have had complications from the vaccine,” wrote someone else. “I’d bet it’s well over 1,000, but you’ll never see that number.”																
45	0	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today released new data showing a total of 1,168,894 reports of adverse events following COVID vaccines were submitted between Dec. 14, 2020, and March 4, 2022, to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). VAERS is the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S.  (Article by Megan Redshaw republished from ChildrensHealthDefense.org)  The data included a total of 25,158 reports of deaths — an increase of 331 over the previous week — and 203,888 reports of serious injuries, including deaths, during the same time period — up 3,557 compared with the previous week.  Excluding “foreign reports” to VAERS, 783,282 adverse events, including 11,505 deaths and 75,286 serious injuries, were reported in the U.S. between Dec. 14, 2020, and March 4, 2022.  Foreign reports are reports foreign subsidiaries send to U.S. vaccine manufacturers. Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, if a manufacturer is notified of a foreign case report that describes an event that is both serious and does not appear on the product’s labeling, the manufacturer is required to submit the report to VAERS.  Of the 11,505 U.S. deaths reported as of March 4, 17% occurred within 24 hours of vaccination, 22% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination and 60% occurred in people who experienced an onset of symptoms within 48 hours of being vaccinated.  In the U.S., 554 million COVID vaccine doses had been administered as of March 4, including 327 million doses of Pfizer, 209 million doses of Moderna and 18 million doses of Johnson & Johnson (J&J).    Every Friday, VAERS publishes vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed. Historically, VAERS has been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events.  U.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to March 4, 2022, for 5- to 11-year-olds show:  9,009 adverse events, including 213 rated as serious and 5 reported deaths. The most recent death involves a 7-year-old boy (VAERS I.D. 2152560) from Washington who died 13 days after receiving his first dose of Pfizer’s COVID vaccine when he went into shock and suffered cardiac arrest. He was unable to be resuscitated and died in the emergency department.  17 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammation). The CDC uses a narrowed case definition of “myocarditis,” which excludes cases of cardiac arrest, ischemic strokes and deaths due to heart problems that occur before one has the chance to go to the emergency department.  32 reports of blood clotting disorders. U.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to March 4, 2022, for 12- to 17-year-olds show:  30,193 adverse events, including 1,734 rated as serious and 40 reported deaths. The most recent death involves a 14-year-old boy (VAERS I.D. 2148498) who experienced a cerebral aneurysm leading to death one day after receiving his first dose of Pfizer’s COVID vaccine.  69 reports of anaphylaxis among 12- to 17-year-olds where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death — with 96% of cases attributed to Pfizer’s vaccine. 650 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis with 631 cases attributed to Pfizer’s vaccine. 161 reports of blood clotting disorders, with all cases attributed to Pfizer. U.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to March 4, 2022, for all age groups combined, show:  19% of deaths were related to cardiac disorders. 54% of those who died were male, 41% were female and the remaining death reports did not include the gender of the deceased. The average age of death was 72.7. As of March 4, 5,233 pregnant women reported adverse events related to COVID vaccines, including 1,664 reports of miscarriage or premature birth. Of the 3,596 cases of Bell’s Palsy reported, 51% were attributed to Pfizer vaccinations, 40% to Moderna and 8% to J&J. 859 reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome, with 41% of cases attributed to Pfizer, 30% to Moderna and 28% to J&J. 2,358 reports of anaphylaxis where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death. 1,632 reports of myocardial infarction. 13,428 reports of blood clotting disorders in the U.S. Of those, 5,992 reports were attributed to Pfizer, 4,784 reports to Moderna and 2,607 reports to J&J. 4,065 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis with 2,499 cases attributed to Pfizer, 1,381 cases to Moderna and 174 cases to J&J’s COVID vaccine. CDC study concludes COVID vaccine adverse events ‘mild’  A study funded by the CDC and published Monday in The Lancet concluded most COVID vaccine-related adverse events reported during the first six months of the rollout in the U.S were “mild and short in duration,” despite thousands of deaths reported to VAERS.  For the study, researchers analyzed data captured between Dec. 14, 2020, and June 14, 2021, by VAERS and v-safe, both of which are overseen by the CDC. Nearly 300 million doses of COVID vaccines were administered during the study period.  The authors found that of the 340,522 adverse events reported to VAERS, 27,023 (8%) were serious, 4,496 were deaths. The authors said the cause of the increased reporting of deaths during the first few days after vaccination might represent “reporting bias.”  The authors suggested that deaths occurring soon after vaccination were more likely to be reported than deaths that occurred later. This, they believe, is why the number of deaths asymptotically approaches zero as more time elapses since vaccination.  Jessica Rose, Ph.D., attempted to duplicate the Lancet authors’ findings through her independent analysis of the VAERS data. Despite filtering the database using three different date stamps, Rose was unable to duplicate the Lancet study’s results.  Florida surgeon general breaks with CDC, recommends against shots for healthy kids  Florida’s surgeon general on Monday said he will issue guidance formally recommending against COVID vaccines for healthy children. Florida is the first state to break with official guidance from the CDC, which recommends all children over age 5 get the vaccine.  Dr. Joseph Ladapo made the announcement at a roundtable, hosted by Gov. Ron DeSantis, featuring physicians and other medical experts who criticized CDC and government policies, including mask mandates and lockdowns, which they said were ineffective and harmful.  Ladapo and DeSantis said the new guidance had to do with lingering questions about the vaccines’ potential health risks for young people and the fact that children are in a low-risk category for severe COVID.  COVID vaccines may be enhancing disease   COVID vaccines may be causing enhanced disease because they target an old version of the coronavirus, Dr. Robert Malone told the Epoch Times in a recent interview.  “The data are showing that vaccination can actually increase the risk of being infected with the Omicron version of this virus,” Malone said, referring to how in some areas, including Scotland and New Zealand, patients hospitalized with COVID are more likely to have received a COVID vaccine.  U.S. drug regulators identified vaccine-associated enhanced diseases (VAED) as an “important potential risk” of COVID vaccines, along with enhanced respiratory disease.  Some adverse events reported following COVID vaccination “could indicate” VAED, according to a CDC team.  VAED refers to disease “resulting from infection in individuals primed with non-protective immune responses against the respective wild-type viruses,” researchers said last year.  “Given that these enhanced responses are triggered by failed attempts to control the infecting virus, VAED typically presents with symptoms related to the target organ of the infection pathogen,” they added.  Vaccine researcher develops tinnitus after COVID shot, calls for further study  Dr. Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minnesota, developed life-altering tinnitus, or ringing in the ear, after receiving his second dose of a COVID vaccine.  “It was like someone suddenly blew a dog whistle in my ear,” Poland told MedPage Today. “It has been pretty much unrelenting.”  Poland then received a booster, after which his tinnitus briefly disappeared but then returned at a slightly higher pitch. Poland realized his life may never be the same and says he has received emails from people across the world struggling with the same condition to the point they’re considering taking their own lives.  Poland, who said he supports COVID vaccines, believes there may be tens of thousands of people affected in the U.S. and is calling for more research to be done to provide help to people desperate for relief.  Michigan woman files claim over mom’s COVID vaccine-related death    Tatum Strieter-Byron is asking the federal government to compensate her for the death in April of her mother Sandra Jacobs. An autopsy confirmed Jacobs died from a blood-clotting disorder caused by J&J’s COVID vaccine.  Strieter-Byron received confirmation Monday her claim to the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) had been received. The program was established to give pharmaceutical companies blanket liability protection from harm caused by their COVID vaccines.  In 2020, the U.S. Health and Human Services secretary invoked the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act and declared COVID-19 a public health emergency, providing J&J other COVID vaccine makers immunity from lawsuits.  The only exception under the PREP Act is if a plaintiff can prove a vaccine-related death or serious physical injury was caused by “willful misconduct.” The protections, unless amended or rescinded, extend through Oct. 1, 2024.  Claims to the CICP must be made within one year of the date the vaccine was received.  Jacobs, 60, received the single-shot vaccine at a CVS pharmacy on April 8, 2021, just five days before federal health agencies temporarily paused the vaccine to examine numerous reports of a serious and potentially fatal blood-clotting disorder.  Jacobs died on April 21 of “complications of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis,” a type of stroke caused by the vaccine.  Children’s Health Defense asks anyone who has experienced an adverse reaction, to any vaccine, to file a report following these three steps.																
46	0	A study included in the first batch of Pfizer documents released on March 1 following a court order indicates that the company’s Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine accumulates in the ovaries over time.  This is significant because official data from the U.K. recently showed that the cases of ovarian cancer in 2021 were at a record high. Also last year, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the U.K.’s drug regulator, received more than 40,000 reports linked to reproductive and menstrual disorders that were suspected as adverse reactions to the vaccines.  The study, which is among the many documents that can be accessed on the Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency website, was conducted on 21 female and 21 male Wistar rats.  Each animal subject was given a single intramuscular dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Then, researchers tested rat blood and tissue samples to determine the content and concentration of total radioactivity in blood, plasma and tissues at pre-defined points after administration.  This means the scientists measured how much of the coronavirus vaccine spread to other parts of the animals’ bodies, such as their skin, liver, spleen and heart.  According to the results, the Pfizer vaccine accumulates in the ovaries over time. An ovary is one of a pair of female glands where eggs form and the female hormones estrogen and progesterone are made.  Within the first 15 minutes of vaccination, the scientists discovered that the total lipid concentration in the ovaries measured 0.104 ml. The figure then increased to 1.34 ml after one hour, 2.34 ml after four hours and 12.3 ml after 48 hours.  The research team didn’t conduct further research on the accumulation after a period of 48 hours, so it remains to be seen if the alarming accumulation continued beyond that time frame. (Related: Pfizer’s COVID vaccine causes miscarriages, stillbirths.)  Links between COVID-19 vaccines and ovarian cancer Official data from the U.K. published by Public Health Scotland contained some alarming clues hinting at the consequences of vaccine accumulation in the ovaries. It presents information concerning different topics like births and babies, child health, cancer, cardiovascular and mental health, injuries, pregnancy and substance use.  In September 2021, Dr. Victoria Male, a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, published an article in the British Medical Journal about a possible link between menstrual changes and the COVID-19 vaccines.  While side effects like soreness in the arm, fever and fatigue are common in vaccinated individuals, others like changes to periods and unexpected vaginal bleeding hint at a potential connection that should be studied further.  She added that the effects of medical interventions on menstruation “should not be an afterthought in future research.” Since clinical trials are the ideal setting for differentiating between menstrual changes caused by interventions from those that occur anyway, volunteers “are unlikely to report changes to periods unless specifically asked.”  “Information about menstrual cycles and other vaginal bleeding should be actively solicited in future clinical trials, including trials of COVID-19 vaccines,” concluded Male.  While it’s impossible to definitively conclude that coronavirus vaccines are the cause of an increase in cases of ovarian cancer, the data from Pfizer and the thousands of menstrual disorders being reported as adverse reactions to the injections suggest something worth investigating.																
47	0	Early on in the plandemic, we reported that unusual HIV insertions had been identified in the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19). This strongly suggested at the time that the virus was a bioweapon constructed in a laboratory.  Since that time, it has been further revealed that Tony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) owns a patent on at least one such HIV insertion, known as gp120.  HIV’s gp120 protein, reports Igor Chudov on his Substack, is the one that activates LFA-1 on CD4 T-Lymphocytes and increases cell susceptibility to LFA-1-targeting leukotoxin, according to a 2011 study.  Interestingly, gp120 just so happens to also be located in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as in the spike protein of all covid “vaccines.”  In a nutshell, gp120, as applied to the spike proteins in both covid and covid injections, effectively destroys the body’s immune T cells in the same way as HIV. And gp120 specifically is used to deliver HIV into the lymphocytes via the LFA-1 receptor.  “T lymphocytes are cells that are responsible for killing infected or cancerous cells,” Chudov explains, citing the science behind T cells and what they do:  “T cells are a type of white blood cell known as a lymphocyte. Lymphocytes protect the body against cancerous cells and cells that have become infected by pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses.”  “T cell lymphocytes are necessary for cell mediated immunity, which is an immune response that involves the activation of immune cells to fight infection. T cells function to actively destroy infected cells, as well as to signal other immune cells to participate in the immune response.”  Covid was clearly developed in a lab using Fauci’s patented HIV insert to destroy human immunity As you can see, T cells are a critical component of healthy immunity. Without them, the body basically has AIDS, which is why a growing body of evidence points to the “fully vaccinated” now having vaccine-induced AIDS, also known as VAIDS.  “The primary mechanism of AIDS is depletion of CD4 cells,” Chudov further explains. “For Sars-CoV-2, we see depletion of CD4 and CD8 cells as well.”  Not only does the Fauci Flu infect T cells, but it also contains the gp120 HIV insert. This is not natural, as there are no known coronaviruses in nature that possess these uniquely harmful traits.  “Amazingly enough, if you still believe in coincidences, HIV also uses the same LFA-1 receptor (as covid) to enter lymphocytes, and uses the same gp120 protein to facilitate the entry,” Chudov writes.  Based on the available research, it is now apparent that Fauci et al. manipulated SARS-CoV-2 to make it target the immune system and deplete it of lymphocytes, just like HIV.  So-called “mild” covid may not leave the immune system decimated of lymphocytes forever, according to Chudov. Those who take the “vaccines,” on the other hand, could face a much worse outcome.  “Fauci is Dr. Mengele … and he should be punished the same way,” someone wrote in response to these revelations.  “Fauci was involved in the HIV ‘pandemic’ of the ’80s,” pointed out another.  “He butted heads with President Reagan over the cause and cure. Fauci suppressed generic drugs and pushed the expensive experimental ‘vaccines.’ He said HIV was airborne and would have killed many millions. He said every age group would be affected. Sound familiar?”  “He was wrong about HIV like he was about Covid. Sars-Covid-2, unlike Sars-Covid-1, has HIV inserted into it. Meaning, it was man-made. Fauci owns the patents and stock in Big Pharma. Coincidence? No. Collusion.”																
48	0	VOSLOORUS, SOUTH AFRICA — A popular, 40-year-old South African DJ and entrepreneur is dead, sending shock waves through the country’s hip-hop community.  (Article by Tumi Mooi republished from TheCOVIDBlog.com)  DJ Dimplez, whose real name is Tumi Mooi, is the founder of Pop Bottles Entertainment, a talent and event branding agency. He was also a very influential presence in South African hip-hop. DJ Dimplez won three South African Hip Hop Awards in 2013, including DJ of the Year. He won the award again in 2014. DJ Dimplez was also a social media influencer, with over 471,000 Twitter followers and 143,000 Instagram followers.  He is best known for his 2014 hits “Way Up” and “Yaya.”      Vaccine promotions and death DJ Dimplez received his first injection on July 21, according to his Instagram page. It’s unclear which injection he received. But several Twitter threads with his friends and fans suggest that it was Pfizer. At least one person in the IG thread did not approve of his decision. Another told the tired “is your 5G improved yet” joke, prompting a laugh out loud emoji from Dimplez.        He received his second injection on September 13, according to his Twitter page.    There’s no indication on Twitter or Instagram that he received a booster shot.  A DJ named Karabo Ted tweeted that Dimplez was performing a gig at a restaurant called Moagi Wings on March 5. “[Dimplez] cried and no one was allowed to be close by,” Karabo Ted wrote. “Now today he’s no more. Weirdest thing I’ve witnessed in my life!! WOW MAN!!”    Another witness on Facebook said he “just collapsed” on stage and was rushed to the hospital.    Buzz Life News reported that he collapsed in his home the morning of March 6.    The Mooi family announced the next day that DJ Dimplez suffered a “sudden brain hemorrhage,” meaning a stroke. He passed away that morning.    His funeral was livestreamed on March 11.  Africans saw through the propaganda Only two countries on the African Continent – Mauritius and Seychelles – have vaccinated 70% or more of their populations, according to the United Nations. But 37 of Africa’s 54 countries are less than 10% vaccinated. We’ve covered only four total vaccine death cases in Africa since The COVID Blog™ started in January 2021.  Ms. Rosette Kyarikunda was the Ugandan medical student who died on August 31, 14 days after her AstraZeneca injection. Mr. Albert Owusu Sarpong was the 20-year-old Ghanaian student who passed away in December after his injection. Digital media strategist Siyabonga Africa was from South Africa. He passed away on July 19, three days after his first Pfizer injection.  Americans, Australians, Canadians, and Europeans are voluntarily wiping themselves out at high rates with the injections. Makes you wonder what the powers-that-be have in store for Africa since the people on the Continent largely shunned the experimental injections. Some of the worst atrocities in human history have been perpetrated by European imperialists in Africa. Few people even know about Leopold II of Belgium. He killed over 10 million people in the Congo, and tortured and maimed millions more in the late 1800s. There’s no telling how many Africans Bill Gates has killed with his evil vaccine wet dreams. Nothing is out of the question there.  We know that the Western world is being depopulated with these mRNA and viral vector DNA injections. History tells us that the powers-that-be are not simply going to allow Africans live and let live. Just hope they are prepared for whatever is coming to them. Stay vigilant and protect your friends and loved ones.																
49	0	Data recently released by the New Zealand government showed fully vaccinated individuals developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS, showing major degradation of the immune system.  Just like other governments before, the New Zealand Ministry of Health only provides a cumulative total of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) cases from August 16, 2021, showing misleading numbers considering that the nation is currently experiencing its biggest outbreak to date.  However, this is not the only problem when it comes to New Zealand’s reporting. On August 16, 2021, the date the Health Ministry has chosen to provide a cumulative total, only 18.4 percent of the population was considered fully vaccinated.  Infections have been increasing, with 20,632 new infections reported on average every day. This is around 99 percent of the peak average reported on March 7.  New Zealand has administered at least 10,757,940 doses of the vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs two doses, that number is enough for 109.4 percent of the country’s population. However, only 78 percent are considered fully vaccinated.  The data presented by the government showed that the real-world two-dose COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness between January 6 to February 11,  proved to be in the negative at -94.4 percent. However, between February 12 to 24, the numbers declined further, with effectiveness estimated to have fallen to -281.35 percent. This means the fully vaccinated are 3.8 times more likely to be infected with COVID-19 than the unvaccinated or single-dose population.  Much of the data that is being released also showed that the shots are slowly giving the population AIDS, which is a complete degradation of the immune system. When this happens, even the slightest cold could be detrimental to their health, as their immune systems will be too weak to fight off the virus. (Related: Dr. Zev Zelenko: Anyone with immune deficiency can die from a cold.)  UK data shows similar evidence The U.K. government also recently released more documentation that showed strong evidence of the COVID-19 vaccine causing AIDS. According to compiled data, vaccine immunity is not supposed to wane. The human immune system, however, can get damaged or degraded.  Vaccine effectiveness, as it turns out, is not the measure of a vaccine per se, but a measure of its effectiveness in terms of the recipient’s immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.  The first time the body encounters a germ, it can take several days to make and use all the germ-fighting tools needed to get over the infection. After, the immune system remembers what it learned about how to protect the body against the disease.  Vaccines, on the other hand, help develop immunity by imitating an infection. Once the imitation goes away, the body is left with a supply of “memory” t-cells and antibodies that will remember how to fight the disease in the future. So when authorities say that vaccine effectiveness weakens over time, they really mean that the immune system is the one that is weakening.  In taking the case rates found in previous reports, tracking the real-world vaccine effectiveness and immune system performance is easy based on previously published data.  Based on the information given, the 40 to 49-year-old age range had the worst immune system performance, which was recorded at -60 percent by January 2. It declined further to -67.7 percent by January 30.  With the information given, it can be gauged that COVID-19 death rates per 100,000, by vaccination status in England, calculated from the number of deaths found and the size of the double-vaccinated population, it seems that the double vaccinated population has the highest death rate per 100,000 in every age group except for the 18 to 29 and 40 to 49-year-olds. However, it is expected that the rate could switch up in the coming weeks.																
50	0	A peer-reviewed study published in the highly-respected Elsevier journal EBioMedicine has revealed that the DTP vaccine unleashed by Bill Gates on young girls in Africa killed 10 times more of them than the disease itself would have.  The paper, commissioned by the Danish government and the Novo Nordisk Foundation, was published back in 2017, though it has not received nearly the attention it deserves. In essence, it exposes Gates as a genocidal murderer who has committed heinous crimes against humanity.  Led by Drs. Søren Wengel Mogensen and Peter Aaby, the study looked at the combination diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus vaccine, which was discontinued in the United States back in the ’90s due to thousands of reports of death and brain damage.  “Despite widespread vaccination,” the Great Game India journal notes, “the United States and other countries are still experiencing large pertussis outbreaks.”  Prior to the publishing of this study, the World Health Organization (WHO) had never bothered to conduct a trial looking at vaccinated versus unvaccinated health outcomes, which would have been necessary to determine whether the DTP vaccine was truly safe and effective.  Even so, Bill and Melinda Gates, arguably the evilest people living today, pushed the drug on innocent African babies, including in Guinea Bissau where half of all children die before the age of five.  Compared to children in Guinea Bissau who did not receive Gates’ DTP vaccine, children who did were found to have died at 10 times the rate of other children. The jab was also found to make vaccinated children more susceptible to other deadly diseases that unvaccinated children do not typically contract.  “The vaccine apparently compromised their immune systems,” Great Game India explains.  The study itself declared that no prospective study “has shown beneficial survival effects of DTP,” despite being “the most widely used vaccine.”  “It should be of concern that the effect of routine vaccinations on all-cause mortality was not tested in randomized trials,” the study further reveals.  “All currently available evidence suggests that DTP vaccine may kill more children from other causes than it saves from diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis. Though a vaccine protects children against the target disease it may simultaneously increase susceptibility to unrelated infections.”  None of this matters to Gates, though, who continues to financially punish nations for not complying with his vaccination programs. Gates has also been caught trying to bribe nations to push more vaccines on their populations, using “mandatory” programs, if necessary, to achieve compliance.  GAVI, which is funded by Gates and the British government, has further infiltrated India’s healthcare policy-making mechanisms, which is now aggressively pushing Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines on Indian people.  Wherever brown and black people can be found, in other words, Bill and Melinda Gates are there working to inject them all with sterilizing, DNA-altering chemicals in the name of public health.  India’s “Covaxin” jab, manufactured by Bharat Biotech, is actually the product of Gates funding through his international pharmaceutical lobby. This is one of the reasons why vaccine truth advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a paper described the billionaire eugenicist as having an “obsession with vaccines.”  “There are revolving door problems with all of our federal agencies and all of our state agencies,” Kennedy stated during an interview on RT from earlier in 2020.  “There’s a phenomenon or a dynamic by which the agency that’s supposed to protect the American public from bad drugs or from pollution of what have you ultimately becomes a subsidiary or a sock puppet for the industry it is supposed to regulate.”																
51	0	A South African public health official has urged compatriots to ignore “fake news” that claims the coronavirus vaccines were designed to kill black people, noting that they are being taken by people from a variety of racial backgrounds.  Dr. Sandile Tshabalala, who leads the department of health for KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, made the remarks last week, according to South African news website Independent Online. He noted that it was odd that South Africans were questioning the coronavirus vaccine, when they were subjected to a variety of different vaccines from an early age:  “The truth of the matter is there is a vaccination programme in South Africa, which starts as soon as you are born. You get to be vaccinated from that time on until you are at least 14 years old.  “You get to be vaccinated with different vaccines, which themselves have different things in them and, as such, you are not even aware what is in this vaccine. But today you want to question this vaccine. That is not normal.  He also added that it was unreasonable to believe the COVID-19 vaccines were designed to kill black people:  “The reality of the matter is, if anyone wanted to kill South Africans using a vaccine, they could have achieved that long ago. “So, it is mere fake news that now there is somebody who want to kill South Africans using any vaccine for that matter. If you’re saying it’s aimed at killing Black people… Everyone across the racial spectrum is getting vaccinated. Then, why would it kill only Black people? It does not make sense. So, there is nothing like that.”  In the U.S., data show that “[w]hile as of September 21, 2021, White adults accounted for the largest share (60%) of unvaccinated adults, Black and Hispanic people remain less likely than their White counterparts to have received a vaccine, leaving them at increased risk, particularly as the variant spreads.”  Some have cited mistrust within the black community of the medical profession and of hospitals as a reason for the lag in vaccination among African Americans.

52	0	A prominent South African doctor who played a key role in developing early treatments for COVID-19 has said that the current vaccine campaigns have one purpose: to “control and kill off a large proportion of our population without anyone suspecting that we were poisoned.”  This controversial claim was made by a family doctor in South Africa, Dr. Shankara Chetty, whose website says he has successfully treated 7,000 patients with COVID-19 without a single death or hospitalization. He is also the doctor behind the “8th Day Therapy for COVID-19” geared toward patients in the disease’s more dangerous inflammatory stage.  In a video recording, Dr. Chetty said that while we all know that there are inconsistencies and coercion going on right now, it is important to understand the reasons. For him, it all boils down to the spike protein.  “If I had to give you my opinion, as to what is happening on a global scale, [the] spike protein is one of the most contrived toxins or poisons that man has ever made,” he stated. “And the aim of this toxin is to kill billions without anyone noticing it. So, it’s a poison with an agenda.”  In his opinion, global lockdowns led patients to get to hospitals later in the disease’s progression, and the protocols used were designed “to engineer death and damage [in order] to stir all the fear” in order to justify vaccinating the planet and exposing all of us to the spike protein for longer.  Too many varied deaths will make it hard to pin the blame on the vaccine He paints a deeply disturbing picture of how the vaccine is going to kill people without ever making itself look like the obvious culprit. The vaccine’s spike protein will be distributed throughout the body via mRNA, he says, and made in different tissues throughout the body.  Brighteon.TV “Those tissues will be recognized as foreign and will trigger a host of autoimmune responses. So, the deaths that are meant to follow the vaccinations will never be able to be pinned on the poison! They will be too diverse, there will be too many, and they will be in too broad a timeframe for us to understand that we have been poisoned,” he said.  The vaccine’s ability to exacerbate pre-existing illnesses means that people’s deaths will instead be blamed on whatever underlying conditions they had, even if those conditions never would have killed them otherwise. This might be cancer flareups spurred by the vaccine that kill patients, whose deaths would then be blamed on the cancer rather than the vaccine. Likewise, diabetics who have strokes and people with hypertension who have heart attacks will have their illnesses attributed to those conditions rather than the vaccines.  While it may sound outlandish to some, he believes that understanding the “endgame” provides lots of clarity. Since the vaccines don’t make sense from a scientific standpoint, he believes this is a more likely explanation.  “But I think if people understand what the intention is, then they’ll understand why what’s happened has happened. The ill logic, the coercion, the suppression, is all warranted if you understand that there is a bigger plan. This plan is to make sure that we can control and kill off a large proportion of our population without anyone suspecting that we were poisoned,” he stated.  Other prominent doctors have taken a somewhat similar stance, including a former senior project manager for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), Geert Vanden Bossch, and highly published physician and COVID-19 expert, Dr. Peter McCullough.  Another expert, former Pfizer Vice President and Chief Scientist for Allergy & Respiratory, Dr. Michael Yeadon, said when posting Dr. Chetty’s video on Telegram: “The vaccine mandates are illogical & frightening, since most aren’t at great risk from the virus in the first place & the vaccines don’t prevent infection or transmission. So, they don’t provide a societal benefit, only a potential individual benefit,” he stated.  “We’d NEVER force people to do something which ONLY benefits them & even then, under unlikely circumstances. It’s nuts. Decline,” he added, referring to the dangerous vaccines.																
53	0	Dr. Shankara Chetty is a world expert on the science and treatment of COVID-19. He treated THOUSANDS of COVID-19 patients at his hospital since the beginning of the pandemic and he has a lot of experience with this.  He is also acutely aware of the COVID-19 agenda which he describes in detail. In this brief and concise 11 minute video, Dr Chetty stitches together his medical knowledge with his political insights. He paints a clear and powerful picture of our current reality. What he said will turn your world upside down and deal a hard blow to your guts:  “This plan is to make sure that we can control and kill off a large proportion of our population without anyone suspecting that we were poisoned and so I think the justification for everything we see is warranted in understanding the endgame.”  “The pathogen that causes all deaths from the disease is the spike protein. And the spike protein is what the vaccine is supposed to make in your body. …Spike protein is one of the most contrived poisons man has ever created. And, the purpose of this poison is to kill billions of people without anyone noticing. So it’s a poison with an agenda.” said South African Physician Dr. Shankara Chetty.																
54	0	Politicians and so-called experts across the planet increasingly want to force you to get inoculated with a substance that takes away at least twice the lives it saves, across all age groups. It doesn’t matter anymore if this is intentional or just sheer incompetence, we have no time left to discuss that. We’re killing people. Millions of people. Our loved ones, family, friends, and neighbors. It has to stop. Now. We have gone mad. Maybe Steve Kirsch’s access to the FDA can help.  And when Steve says the vaccines killed 200,000 Americans so far already, and permanently disabled 300,000, remember that this is just the tip of the iceberg: many if not most of the effects will only show up later. And then Pfizer today claims that their stuff is safe for kids 5 years old and up. Who are 99.9996% safe if they get infected, due to their immune system, which also gets killed by the vaccines.  And I would have some questions about the people “saved” by the vaccines. Because a recent Israel study suggests only that “a booster can strengthen protection for a few weeks in older adults.” A few weeks? And we call that a vaccine now?  Stop it. We have gone mad.        The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may have opened Pandora’s box on Covid. Not sure why, but for some reason they invited Steve Kirsch to a virtual meeting of the FDA Vaccine Advisory Committee, aka the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, on September 17. The same committee that decided not to recommend booster shots for all Americans.  Kirsch is an entrepreneur who started several companies in the computing field, for instance Infoseek. He’s worth a few hundred million dollars. He also set up treatearly.org, which promotes early treatment for Covid. Didn’t anyone at the FDA know that in March, Kirsch offered $1 million to anyone who could prove fluvoxamine was not what saved 77 people in a trial, and identify what did?  Or that he offered $10,000 for a one hour debate on Covid? Or did someone at the FDA open Pandora’s box on purpose? And I know, officially the committee is independent from the FDA, and I don’t know what role Kirsch played in the 16-2 decision against boosters, but there are obviously some people there who feel uncomfortable with the current vaccine-at-all-costs approach. I wouldn’t rule out it was done on purpose. But the info is out there now, and YouTube and Twitter are not going to ban or shadowban the FDA.  Wikipedia about Kirsch is fun:  In April 2020, he started the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund (CETF) with a personal donation of $1M in order to fund COVID-19 drug repurposing research. In May 2021, Kirsch posted an article online making an unfounded claim that COVID-19 vaccines affect fertility, while also underplaying the vaccines’ ability to prevent illness and death. The following month, Kirsch appeared in a YouTube video posted with Bret Weinstein and Robert W. Malone to discuss COVID-19 vaccines. In the video, Kirsch makes several false claims, including that spike proteins used in COVID-19 vaccines are “very dangerous”.  And he’s banned from YouTube and Twitter:        Here’s part of his presentation to the committee. The vaccines kill twice as many people as they save.        I summarized part of his latest slide deck here:     What You Need To Know About Covid Vaccine Safety  Censorship required The way to fight truth is using misinformation, intimidation, mandates, and censorship. Our government is ignoring early treatments and tells everyone that early treatment don’t work. They demonize the key treatment used by India to be COVID-free. Their agenda is to push the vaccine, not to cure COVID. Social media companies will censor, demonetize, and/or ban you for telling the truth. If you are a doctor, you can have your license revoked if you say the vaccines are unsafe.  COVID vaccines kill more people than they save for all age groups. On average, in the US, COVID vaccines kill 2 people for every person they save over a 6 month period.  To date 200K Killed 300K permanently disabled  Here’s how we compute the 2:1 ratio that shows the vaccines are nonsensical.  V:C defined  V:C is the ratio of the the number of vaccine-caused deaths (V) relative to the projected number of COVID deaths (C) that could be saved by the vaccine over a 6 month period. A number like 2:1 means we kill 2 people for every COVID death we save. That’s bad. For a COVID vaccine to be viable, you’re looking for V:C of 1:x where x > 100, i.e., you want the risk to be very small compared to the benefit. If you are saving the lives of >100,000 people, you don’t want to have to kill >1,000 people to have to do that. That would completely unacceptable in a civilized society and would be unprecedented in modern times, especially when we have early treatments that work with over 99% risk reduction that don’t have any safety issues.  V:C varies by place, time, age. V:C depends on the vaccine type, the rate of COVID deaths in your community at a particular time, and your age. For this presentation, we’ll compute this as a country-wide average for the US.  Determining V. In general, the three vaccines in the US work through a very similar process. The vaccines have an estimated death rate of close to 1 death for every 1,000 people who are vaxed. Here, we calculate a deaths per million doses for each age range (using VAERS). For risk/reward assessments done by age, this gives the most precise guidance.  See also  APPLE IPHONE IS ABOUT TO GO INTO PEOPLE'S EYES Determining C. We use COVID mortality data from the CDC to determine the risk of death from COVID.        Is the vaccine safe for some age groups? The vaccines may have a positive risk/benefit for people in a certain demographic. The CDC and FDA think the vaccines are perfectly safe and have killed no one, so they have never done this analysis. For example, the VRBPAC unanimously approved boosters for people over 65. None of the panel members made the risk-benefit calculation. They were guessing. Were they right? No. They were dead wrong based on both our calculations and the real-world evidence. Here’s what the detailed calculations showed…  V:C in the US is not favorable for any age. The table shows the V:C numbers by age.        You can read this article which details how all these numbers were calculated. So for kids, we kill over 6 kids to save 1 kid from a COVID death. Mandating vaccination for anyone, especially school-age children, is proof of a corrupt society. Therefore, it’s nonsensical to vaccinate any age group. The FDA VRBPAC committee concluded that there is a benefit for 65 year old and older, but they refused to consider the mortality caused.        The full presentation, all 8+ hours of it. I set it to start at the point where Kirsch comes in, but knock yourself out.             Here are some earlier things by Kirsch.     From August 31:  Open Letter to CDC  I am the founder of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund (www.treatearly.org). Our work in funding early treatments for COVID was featured on 60 Minutes. I have been vaccinated and my entire family has been vaccinated. However, shortly after I was fully vaccinated, I began to hear stories from my friends that were very troubling. For example, one friend had three relatives who were formerly healthy die after getting the vaccine. Another friend had a heart attack 2 minutes after the injection and is now disabled, apparently for life. I assembled a team of over 19 doctors and scientists listed at the end of this comment to investigate the available evidence. Using the VAERS database and other official government data sources from the US and around the world (covering 35% of the world’s population), we found evidence that clearly demonstrates that the current vaccines are significantly more dangerous than has been previously believed.  Our most important findings include:  1/ The “real world” fatality data from VAERS does not match the fatality data from the Phase 3 trials. They aren’t even close. Using multiple independent methods, we estimate that over 150,000 Americans have already been killed. It is urgent to resolve this discrepancy as soon as possible as we strongly believe that the real world data is right and the vaccines should be immediately stopped.  2/ None of the COVID vaccines reduce all-cause morbidity. It’s the opposite: they all significantly increase all-cause morbidity by as much as 4.2 times baseline (p<=0.00001). The CDC must know this since this information is hiding in plain sight in the published literature. What is the point of offering an optional medical intervention which significantly increases all-cause morbidity when safer alternatives such as early treatment are available?  3/ There is an error in the adverse event detection formula used by the CDC that appears to have prevented the CDC from seeing the safety signals that were obvious to our VAERS experts.  4/ Early treatment and prophylaxis protocols are a superior option to the current vaccines, yet have been inexplicably ignored by the NIH: • Higher relative risk reduction (over 99%) • Greater safety (minor temporary side effects, known safety profile) – They lower both all-cause mortality and all-cause morbidity – They work equally well on all variants – They do not promote escape variants – They do not cause vaccine enhanced infectivity/replication – They do not cause prion diseases – They prevent long-haul COVID syndrome nearly 100% of the time – They enable people to acquire recovered immunity which is both 13 times stronger and more durable than vaccine-induced immunity  We recommend the committee take the following actions: • Require autopsies for all deaths within 4 weeks of any COVID19 vaccination so that data is available to compute an estimate of the true all-cause mortality. • Make available the analysis of the 11,000 deaths investigation in VAERS for public inspection. It’s important for the public to understand why the CDC couldn’t attribute a single death to the vaccine whereas one of the world’s top pathologists ascribed at least 30% of all deaths to the vaccine. • Explain publicly why there is a death peak on the second day after vaccination if the vaccinations are perfectly safe and not causing deaths. • Explain publicly why the severe adverse side effects are dose dependent  [..] • Recommend that vaccine mandates should not be issued without evidence of a statistically significant all-cause morbidity decrease (which there is not in this case). • Define a COVID vaccine stopping condition after which that vaccine should be halted until the stopping issues are addressed. In 1976, the stopping threshold was 35 deaths.        From June 12:  Should You Get Vaccinated?  At least 6,000 deaths from the vaccine. The OpenVAERS team think it is over 20,000 due to under reporting. Biodistribution data shows massive accumulation in ovaries of the LNP (which instructs cells in ovaries to sprout toxic spike protein). Whoops. That was never supposed to be leaked out. We obtained it via FOIA request. The CDC never told you about that one, did they? Of course not! 82% miscarriage rate in first 20 weeks (10% is the normal rate). It is baffling that the CDC says the vaccine is safe for pregnant women when it is so clear that this is not the case. For example, one our family friends is a victim of this. She miscarried at 25 weeks and is having an abortion on 6/9/21. She had her first shot 7 weeks ago, and her second shot 4 weeks ago. The baby had severe bleeding of the brain and other disfigurements. Her gynecologist had never seen anything like that before in her life. They called in a specialist who said it was probably a genetic defect (because everyone buys into the narrative that the vaccine is safe it is always ruled out as a possible cause). No VAERS report. No CDC report. Yet the doctors I’ve talked to say that it is over 99% certain it was the vaccine. The family doesn’t want an autopsy for fear that their daughter will find out it was the vaccine. This is a perfect example of how these horrible side effects just never get reported anywhere. 25X the possibility of myocarditis for teen boys (can lead to heart failure and death) Kids already have natural immunity (Science Magazine article), so there is no benefit to vaccination, only risk. Have you ever seen the risk / benefit analysis by the CDC?? Ask for it before you consent. No point vaccinating those who’ve had COVID-19: Findings of Cleveland Clinic study. No benefit, only risk. Doctors who attribute adverse events to the vaccine are punished (such as Dr. Hoffe). So under reporting is incentivized. The CDC refuses to say how many people have died and is “still investigating” heart damage in kids even though it is obvious why (free spike protein causing clotting and inflammation). A 25X increase when the only “new” thing is the vaccine isn’t hard to figure out. Ask the CDC for their current top 5 hypotheses for the cause. It will be more than amusing to see what they say. If it isn’t the vaccine, heads should roll. The CDC is deliberately misleading the American people. Check out the side effects page. Death, disability, excessive miscarriage rates, heart attacks, stroke, inability to walk, talk, or see, Bell’s Palsy, persistent pain, Parkinson’s like symptoms, re-activation of shingles, blood clots, etc. are all missing. >500X more deadly than the flu vaccine COVID vaccines have generated more adverse reports in the last 6 months than all 70 vaccines over the past 30 years combined. They missed that one. Defective virus design (s1 was never supposed to be free, inclusion of PEG was unnecessary and allows LNP to be widely distributed) Strong opposition to vaccination by extremely credible voices like Malone, Geert Vanden Bossche, others NIAID (Cliff Lane) is improperly manipulating the COVID Treatment Guidelines to make it appear these drugs do not work, thus giving the world the false impression that the vaccine, even if imperfect, is the only way out. Ivermectin and fluvoxamine have been confirmed in Phase 3 trials. Ivermectin has a very high quality systematic review, the highest possible level in Evidence Based Medicine. Repurposed drugs are safer and more effective than the current vaccines. In general, early treatment with an effective protocols reduce your risk of dying by more than 100X so instead of 600,000 deaths, we’d have fewer than 6,000 deaths. NOTE: The vaccine has already killed over 6,000 people and that’s from the vaccine alone (and doesn’t count any breakthrough deaths). Vaccines skipped proper toxicology studies in order to bring to market faster. We don’t know what we don’t know. The unpredictable and horrifying side effects of this vaccine on heathy kids, such as the 16 year old girl who was unable to speak and see just 48 hours after being vaccinated Debilitating side effects can happen at any time because vaccine victims are very similar to COVID long haulers (Dr. Bruce Patterson has discovered this) and we all know that long haul can start at anytime (even when the disease is asymptomatic) and could be incurable. Because the vaccine is not perfectly safe, the government is required by law to warn people of the death and disability risks caused by the vaccine and to obtain informed consent. Always be sure to ask for the 50 most serious side effects and how often they happen. And find out whether they will compensate you if you are disabled for life from the vaccine. This is important because the blood clots can form anywhere with this very unsafe [vaccine] .

And if you don’t take them, you will be an outcast. We have gone outrageously mad.

Dr. Merritt has been in the private practice of Orthopaedic and Spinal Surgery since 1995, has served on the Board of the Arizona Medical Association, and is past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.  Dr. Merritt recently addressed the American Frontline Doctors and discussed how all through 2020 there were only 20 deaths among all active duty military personnel related to COVID. However, there are now many reports of tumors and over 80 cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), which has a 5-year mortality rate of around 66%, following the COVID-19 shots given to the military.  WITH THE VACCINE PROGRAM WE’VE OSTENSIBLY KILLED MORE OF OUR YOUNG ACTIVE DUTY PEOPLE THAN COVID DID.  This is the not the first time the military has been implicated in killing active duty military with experimental vaccines. It happened also during the Gulf War with the experimental anthrax vaccine, which some estimates claim killed 35,000 military people with what was originally termed “Gulf War Syndrome.”  I have produced a video that includes an Army wife of an active duty soldier in South Korea explain how her previously healthy husband now has major heart problems after taking the COVID-19 vaccines, followed by a medic whistleblower who explains what lengths the military will go to to cover up deaths related to experimental vaccines.  Please watch this and share with everyone you know in the military, so we don’t see a repeat in history of what happened with the anthrax vaccine.  It is better to risk court martial and losing your military career than to give up your life for a vaccine, or become permanently disabled for what is now the largest public vaccine trial ever conducted upon humanity.

56	0	The 1918 Influenza Epidemic  VERY FEW PEOPLE realize that the worst epidemic ever to hit America, the Spanish Influenza of 1918 was the after effect of the massive nation-wide vaccine campaign. Viruses were not known at that time so the doctors told the people that the disease was caused by germs. Germs, bacteria and viruses, along with bacilli and a few other invisible organisms are the scapegoats, which the doctors like to blame for the things they do not understand.  If we check back in history to that 1918 flu period, we will see that it suddenly struck just after the end of World War I when American soldiers were returning home from overseas, although there was a suggestion that the virus strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and pigs which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease. WWI was the first war in which multiple vaccines were forced on all U.S. servicemen.  “It was a common expression during the war that more soldiers were killed  by vaccine shots than by shots from enemy guns.”—E. McBean  This concoction of poisonous drugs and putrid proteins of which the vaccines were composed, caused such widespread disease and death among the soldiers that it was the common talk of the day, that more of our men were being killed by medical shots than by enemy gunfire.   US Army records show that seven men dropped dead after being vaccinated. A report from US Secretary of War Henry L Stimson not only verified these deaths but also stated that there had been 63 deaths and 28,585 cases of hepatitis as a direct result of yellow fever vaccination during only six months of the war. And that was only ONE of the 14 to 25 shots given to recruits.  Life at Camp Dix Trenton, NJ Life at Camp Dix Trenton, NJ  ARMY RECORDS also reveal that after vaccination became compulsory in the US Army in 1911, not only did typhoid increase rapidly but all other vaccinal diseases increased at an alarming rate. After America entered the war in 1917, the death rate from typhoid vaccination rose to the highest point in the history of the US Army.  The report of the Surgeon-General of the US Army shows that during 1917 there were admitted into the army hospitals 19,608 men suffering from anti-typhoid inoculation and vaccinia. The army doctors knew all these cases of disease and death were due to vaccination and were honest enough to admit it in their medical reports.  IT IS KNOWN that vaccines often cause other diseases besides the one for which they are given. For instance, smallpox vaccine often causes syphilis, paralysis, leprosy, and cancer. (See the chapters on smallpox and plagues.) Polio shots, diphtheria toxin-antitoxin, typhoid vaccine, as well as measles, tetanus and all other shots often cause various other stages of disease such as post-vaccinal encephalitis (inflammation of the brain,) paralysis, spinal meningitis, blindness, cancer (sometimes within two years,) tuberculosis, (two to twenty years after the shot,) arthritis, kidney disease, heart disease (heart failure sometimes within minutes after the shot and sometimes several hours later.) Nerve damage and many other serious conditions also follow the injections.  When doctors had tried to suppress the symptoms of the typhoid with a stronger vaccine, it caused a worse form of typhoid which they named paratyphoid. But when they concocted a stronger and more dangerous vaccine to suppress that one, they created an even worse disease which they didn’t have a name for. What should they call it? They didn’t want to tell the people what it really was — their own Frankenstein monster which they had created with their vaccines and suppressive medicines. They wanted to direct the blame away from themselves, so they called it Spanish Influenza.  Writing in the ‘Lancet’, Dr. William Collins of Oxford, says – “Surely we are seeing a type of influenza quite different from anything we have seen before. I well remember the severe epidemic of 1889-90 and attended a large number of cases, but the signs and symptoms which have been exhibited by patients I have attended during the past few days are quite new to me.”  After the war, this was one of the vaccines used in a vain attempt to protect a panic-stricken world from the soldiers returning from WWI battlefronts infected with dangerous diseases. The only ones who would ultimately escape the influenza were those who refused the vaccinations.   2013: SILENT EPIDEMIC, by award winning film director Gary Null, is the first documentary to investigate thoroughly the true medical record and the historical evidence about vaccine marvels. Interviewing leading private physicians, pediatricians, immunologists, biomolecular chemists, parents of vaccine-injured children, and legal experts voicing opposition to human rights violations over mandated vaccination, the film deconstructs the conventional vaccine hypothesis.  What really goes into the making of a vaccine that is being injected directly into the blood stream? Rather than worthy of praise, vaccine health risks have become a scourge injuring untold numbers of children, adults and families. Viewers will be introduced to the primitive technology for making vaccines, their life-threatening ingredients, and the hidden story world health agencies don’t want you to know. For people who have accepted vaccines’ promises, “Silent Epidemic” will certainly make them rethink its mythology. | More: Gary Null | podcast  THE DOCTORS didn’t want this massive vaccine disease blunder to reflect on them, so they agreed among themselves to call it Spanish Influenza. Spain was a neutral country during WWI, with no reporting restrictions, so the idea of siting the outbreak there seemed to be a good way for the medics to distance themselves from any scandal. The Spanish resented having the scourge planted on them, as they knew the flu didn’t originate in their country.  The 1918 flu was the most devastating disease in history, and it brought forth a profusion of medical tricks to try and control it, but the administering of poisionous, contaminated vaccines only worsened the weakened condition of the people, and the treatments ended up killing exponentially more people than the flu itself.  CampFunstonKS-InfluenzaHospital  It is estimated that the 1918 flu epidemic killed around 50 million people throughout the world—or as far away as the vaccinations reached. The truth of the matter is that most died from the crude and deadly vaccinations administered by their doctors.  “Medical historians have finally come to the reluctant conclusion that the great flu “epidemic” of 1918 was solely attributable to the widespread use of vaccines. It was the first war in which vaccination was compulsory for all servicemen. The Boston Herald reported that forty-seven soldiers had been killed by vaccination in one month.”—Eustace Mullins  More: whale.to | rense.com | spktruth2power | Aspirin Misuse May Have Made 1918 Flu Pandemic Worse  Vaccine-Induced Disease Epidemic Outbreaks | Flu Vaccine is the most Dangerous Vaccine in the U.S.  bio-weapons  Was it a Bio-Weapon?  SYMPTOMS of the 1918 ‘influenza’ virus were so unusual that initially it was misdiagnosed as dengue, cholera, or typhoid. Many observers noted atypical complications such as mucous membrane hemorrhaging of the nose, stomach, and intestine, and bleeding from the ears and under the skin. Another unusual feature was that half the dead were healthy young adults, 20 to 40 years old.  In 1948 Heinrich Mueller, the former head of the Gestapo, told his CIA Interrogator that the influenza pandemic of 1918-19, the most devastating plague in human history, was man-made.  At a 1944 Nazi bacteriological warfare conference in Berlin, General Walter Schreiber, Chief of the Medical Corps of the German Army told Mueller that he had spent two months in the US in 1927 conferring with his counterparts. They told him that the “so-called double blow virus” (i.e. Spanish Flu) was developed and used during the 1914 war. (This should come as no surprise because the US Army has a record of experimenting with drugs, chemicals and bacteria on its unwary soldiers.  According to Mueller’s testimony, the flu started as a US army bacteriological warfare experiment that somehow infected US army ranks at Camp Riley KS in March 1918, then “got out of control” and spread around the world. | More: “Gestapo Chief: The 1948 CIA Interrogation of Heinrich Mueller.”  More: henrymakow.com | See also: Scientists recreate 1918 flu virus, see parallels with H5N1    OCTOBER 2011: A shock vaccine study reveals that influenza vaccines only prevent the flu in 1.5 out of 100 adults—not 60% as you’ve been told. So what are these vaccinations really for? You won’t like this answer, but many believe flu shots are designed to “soft kill” the global population!  “Vaccines are population control technologies, as openly admitted by Bill Gates and they are so cleverly packaged under the fabricated “public health” message that even those who administer vaccines have no idea they are actually engaged in the reduction of human population through vaccine-induced infertility and genetic mutations.  “Vaccines ultimately have but one purpose: To permanently alter the human gene pool and “weed out” those humans who are stupid enough to fall for vaccine propaganda.  And for that nefarious purpose, they probably are 60% effective after all.”—Eva Snead, M.D.  See also: BILL GATES fears a Spanish flu-like disease could wipe out 33 million people [he should know]  BILL GATES’ Polio Vaccine Program Caused 47,500 Cases of Paralysis Deaths | Vaccines [search]   Pentagon clear to give anthrax shots again | Armed Forces Given Untested & Experimental Vaccines  Shots in the Dark: Unanswered Questions Plague The Military Vaccine Program | More  NVIC-Chart  More & more: 75% of children who received vaccines in Mexican town now dead or hospitalized | Tetanus Vaccines Found Spiked With Sterilization Chemical | CDC admits 98 million Americans were given cancer virus via the polio shot | What’s Really Behind Mandatory Vaccines  vaccination  Genocide: Vaccine Kills More Children  JAPAN HALTS VACCINES from Pfizer, Sanofi after deaths of four children  The deaths just keep mounting all across the world: Children are collapsing into comas and then dying, just minutes after receiving combination vaccines that have been deceptively marketed as “completely safe.” Last year, Australia temporarily banned flu vaccines in children after they were found to have caused vomiting, fevers and seizures.  Today the damage from vaccines is emerging in Japan, where the health ministry has suspended the use of vaccines from Pfizer and Sanofi-Aventis following the deaths of four children there who died within minutes of receiving these vaccine shots.  All four children received combination vaccines, where multiple shots are combined into one high-potency injection. MMR is another example of a combination vaccine shot that combines vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella. There is very strong evidence that vaccines are far more dangerous when given in combination than when given one at a time.  In the USA there have been more than 59,000 reports of adverse reactions to pneumococcal and Hib vaccines during the past few years. More than half of these cases – 30,094 – required hospitalization, with 2,169 deaths  The great vaccine damage cover-up  What will now happen in Japan is that a group of vaccine safety experts will meet to discuss the vaccines, and no doubt most of the members of that group will be paid off by Big Pharma. Within a day or two, a statement will be issued that states there is “no causal relationship exists between vaccines and child deaths” and the vaccine program will continue as usual. The ongoing deaths of children will be ignored or explained away as “mere coincidence.”  How many coincidences does it take to make a pattern? If you’re one of the brainwashed vaccine zealots, there is never a pattern. ALL deaths are automatically considered “coincidence,” no matter how many occur or how frequently they appear. A true scientist, of course, would observe the pattern and realize there is a cause-and-effect phenomenon taking place. But then again, vaccine zealots are nothing like real scientists. They are propagandists.  This is how the vaccine industry operates every day: Lie to the public that the vaccines are 100% safe and effective, then deny any hint of vaccines causing damage to anyone. It’s a double-layer deception. First, there’s the deception that vaccines are safe (they aren’t, and the vaccine industry refuses to subject them to scientific clinical trials versus non-vaccinated children in order to prevent this truth from coming out), and secondly that vaccines don’t damage anyone. That’s yet another lie: Vaccines cause untold damage to the neurology of children and adults alike.  Children are routinely killed by vaccines, and vaccines are being pushed in the false context that presumes vaccines are the only way to protect children from infectious disease in the first place. Nutrition actually works better, and it doesn’t kill children. But that’s not the choice presented to parents. The choice is either vaccination or non-vaccination. The choice is never presented as vaccination or vitamin D supplementation, is it?  The real cost in human suffering  If vaccines are so safe, then why do so many healthy young children suddenly collapse into autism in the hours or days following vaccination? Why is this neurological damage a global phenomenon that almost always occurs in children who are vaccinated? Why are non-vaccinated children so much healthier, more vibrant, more intelligent and more immune to infectious disease?  The vaccine industry doesn’t want you to ask these questions. You’re supposed to just accept their propaganda, take your shot, and keep coming back for more, year after year. If your child gets autism, it your fault, not theirs (according to them). If your child collapses into a coma and dies, you have no legal recourse because the U.S. Supreme Court has made it illegal to sue for damages from vaccine companies.  The entire medical system has been configured to suppress vaccine lawsuits and deny the evidence of vaccine damage and death. The court system denies justice to anyone whose children are damaged or killed by vaccines. And parents who question the safety of vaccines are ridiculed by doctors and even called “baby killers” by Bill Gates, who has funneled tens of billions of dollars into mass vaccination campaigns despite the fact that vaccines are killing children.  Of course, the vaccine industry claims its vaccines are saving far more children than they are killing (they claim their vaccines kill exactly zero children, by the way — a number that is an obvious lie). But even this argument falls flat when you consider that using nutrition to enhance immune function is far more effective than using vaccines. Even the Nobel prize winning Luc Montagnier, co-discoverer of the AIDS virus, says you can cure AIDS with a strong, healthy immune system. Much the same is true with nearly every other common infectious disease: Strong immune function resists infection far better than any vaccine. Vitamin D, for example, also works to prevent tuberculosis. The CDC has never admitted it publicly, of course, because the CDC is a political organization that protects the profits of the vaccine makers.  When it comes to what’s real versus what’s just corporate propaganda, one thing is certain: Scientific facts have never stood in the way of vaccine profits. The vaccine industry has become an unstoppable death machine based on non-existent science and arrogant quackery. It has become a huge profit center for the medical industry, of course, because much of the damage caused by vaccines results in future medical care profits that feed the drug companies.  What’s clear from all this is that vaccines are great at one thing: Population control.  “The world today has 6.8 billion people… that’s headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.”—Bill Gates  As of this week, the population of children in Japan has been reduced by four. And more vaccine-induced deaths are no doubt happening all across the world that go unreported or are intentionally censored out the medical records.    vaccination-1  THE BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION have geared up their family efforts to decrease population sizes worldwide through the use of the Oral Polio Vaccine. Recently the World Health Organization reported that the Type 2 Polio Virus has been eradicated in nature and that the Oral Polio Vaccine is the only means by which this virus is being spread through the human population.  The Gates Foundation Wants to Change Your DNA  Through the use of the GAVI Alliance (formerly the “Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation” ) the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and UNICEF (United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund) the global eugenicists have started their use of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) in Africa. Already the initial two million dosages have caused 47,500 cases of paralytic polio in children linked directly to the VDPV Vaccine Derived Polio Virus.  THE OPV given to children stays active in their system for up to two months with the live virus being shed in their stool and saliva. This puts unvaccinated children at risk due to the OPV’s ability to cross-contaminate. Inevitably the media will spin the story, blaming the unvaccinated children for the outbreak.  NOW JUMP into the research and development end of the spectrum and the Gates are hard at work mutating genomes of any animal they might be able to get their hands on. In this instance we see them focusing their higher sense of evil perversions towards the already satanically demonized goat. Remember the goat is used as a symbolic reference to Lucifer or Satan at least in modern day subcultures.  This makes the goat the perfect place for the Gates to start their new plan of turning the animals into manufacturing plants converting their bodies into cultivation units similar to what we see in the movie “The Matrix”. Although in this case it’s not a battery they are creating instead the goat is a living breathing biological weapon that just so happens to be indigenous to the African continent and a communal source of food for the locals…																
57	0	We can officially confirm that the number of people who have died due to the Covid vaccines within the past 6 months is almost double the amount of people who have died of Covid-19 since March 2020.  We are able to confirm this thanks to data published by Public Health England Scotland, alongside the data published by the MHRA on the Yellow Card Report scheme. However, the true picture is likely much worse due to the vast amount of recorded deaths due to the jabs occurring in Scotland. This is because Public Health England refuses to the publish the same data.  I recommend that you take a look for yourselves at the UK Government Website Coronavirus vaccine – weekly summary of Yellow Card reporting. You can access it here :- https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting  Here is a screen shot taken today, 18th July 2021. This shows the ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS from the administered vaccines up to July 7th 2021.   According to data published by the NHS on deaths related to Covid-19 up to the 10th June 2021 there have been 87,253 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. However, of these just 3,591 died of Covid-19, whereas the remainder all had pre-existing conditions ranging from heart disease to dementia.  The 83,662 who died with pre-existing conditions may have only been added to the Covid death statistics because they received a positive test result for the SARS-CoV-2 virus within 28 days of their death. A test result that will have come about due to hospitals essentially mandating tests are carried out before treatment is offered, despite this being against the law.  The test used is the PCR test, which cannot detect infection and can find anything it wants to find if conducted at a high cycle rate, producing false positives, therefore it is not hard to see why tens of thousands of people who have died of other causes have been added to the Covid death statistics.   Using the figure of 3,591 people who have allegedly died of Covid-19 according to the NHS data, we can see that an average of 239.4 people have died per month since March 2020 through to June 2021.  This includes just 3,501 people over the age of 40, and a mere 90 people under the age of 40.  This really put things into perspective when you take the known figure of people who have died due to the Covid-19 vaccines. Since the 9th December 2020 through to the 30th June 2021 a total of 450 deaths have been reported to the MHRA Yellow Card scheme as adverse reactions to the Pfizer mRNA Covid-19 vaccine. An average of 75 per month.   Since the 5th January 2021 through to the 30th June 2021 a total of 960 recorded deaths have been reported to the MHRA Yellow Card scheme as adverse reactions to the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. An average of 160 per month.   The Moderna mRNA vaccine has also had 6 reports of death made against it. The MHRA Yellow Card scheme has also received 24 reports of death where the brand of vaccine were not specified.  This means the total number of deaths reported to the MHRA Yellow Card scheme as adverse reactions to all of the emergency approved Covid-19 vaccines in the past 6 months comes to a total of 1,440 up to the 30th June 2021. This is an average of 240 deaths occurring per month. This stat alone already outnumbers the average number of deaths per month of people who have died of Covid-19 by 0.6.  However, we also have data released by Public Health Scotland to work with.  A report released by PHS on the 23rd June 2021 has revealed that between the 8th December 2020 and the 11th June 2021 a total number of 5,522 people died within 28 days of having a dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.  According to the spreadsheet provided by Public Health Scotland which includes the quantity of deaths by type of vaccine and the date they occurred, 1,877 deaths have been due to the Pfizer jab, 3,643 deaths have been due to the AstraZeneca jab, and 2 deaths have been due to the Moderna jab.  This equates to an average of 920 deaths occurring every month due to the Covid-19 vaccines in Scotland alone. Outnumbering the average number of people who have died of Covid-19 in England by 680.6 per month.   Combining the total number of deaths reported to the MHRA as adverse reactions to the Covid-19 jabs, with the total number of deaths recorded within 28 days of having a Covid-19 jab in Scotland, we can see that on record there have been 6,962 deaths in the past 6 months due to the Covid-19 vaccines. This is almost double the number of people who have died of Covid-19 in England in the past 15 months.  This also means that based on the data available, 1,160 people are dying every month due to the Covid-19 vaccines on average. This outnumbers the average number of people who die of Covid-19 every month by 920.9.  Using the data on the number of deaths due to the Covid-19 vaccines in Scotland we can also estimate what the likely number of deaths are due to the jabs in England. Adjusting to the size of the population we estimate the actual number of deaths due to the jabs in England in the past 6 months could be as high as 57,470.  “But Devi Sridhar said they are 100% safe”, we hear you cry. Well, we’re sorry to inform you she didn’t tell the truth.  The data for Scotland also reveals that the number of deaths due to the Covid-19 vaccines in 6 months are ten times greater than the number of people who have died of Covid-19 between March 2020 and January 2021. A freedom of information request made on the 30th January asked the Scottish Government to reveal the total number of people who had died of Covid-19 since March 2020.  To which the Scottish Goverment responded on the 11th March 2021 with –  “The answer to your question is 596 deaths involving COVID-19 has been registered where there was no pre-existing medical condition between March 2020 and January 2021 (including).”   Whichever way you look at it, the data shows that the Covid-19 vaccines are killing far more people than Covid-19 ever has. The problem you have now is that they want to vaccinate your children next.																
58	0	6 Billion People Humans To Be Killed By The Elite – NWO Depopulation Agenda – Holistic Doctors Who Died Mysteriously Exposed The Dangers of Vaccines and Cures For Cancer: Back in 2015 reports of the suspicious deaths of holistic doctors who exposed the many deadly dangers of vaccines and the correlation to austim began. The mysterious deaths of holistic doctors continue, without any mainstream media reporting, as many of the deaths have “plausible deniability”, which is the top facet of all mass media manipulation and deception.   …  Since 2015, there has been a major campaign to disprove all of these deaths as “conspiracy theories.” I knew back then that these holistic doctors were killed to silence their voices regarding the dangers of vaccines and the increasing rise of autism. But there may have been another reason. Once the COVID-19 “scamdemic” was launched these doctors would have been screaming at the top of their voices. Many physicians who survive have screamed about the dangers of the COVID-19 mRNA injections, like Dr. Joseph Mercola and Dr. Sherri Tenpenny. These physicians have a huge following. The doctors who died “mysteriously” were not nearly as well known, but all had influence and would have trumpeted the dangers of the mRNA vaccines creating a large chorus. Could that be why there was a barrage of mysterious holistic doctor deaths over the course of a few short years? Very possible. Also: JFK’S 1961 Prophecy EXPOSES Obama, Hillary, Pope Francis, and the NWO. Must Watch Video As I have mentioned many times, the world has been engaged in a silent war waged by the global elite fought with quiet weapons since 1954. The COVID-19 scamdemic is the culmination of the elite’s 63 year plan to reduce the world population to 500,000,000. We are in the ‘end phase’ of their clandestine depopulation agenda that is hidden in plain sight for all to see, read and hear. The elite talk about it   …  4/36 and they write about it. These facts cannot be denied. 30 Population Control Quotes That Show That The Elite Truly Believe That Humans Are A Plague Upon The Earth The following are 30 population control quotes which show that the elite truly believe that humans are a plague upon the earth and that a great culling is necessary… 1. UK Television Presenter Sir David Attenborough: “We are a plague on the Earth. It’s coming home to roost over the next 50 years or so.   …  5/36 It’s not just climate change; it’s sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde. Either we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us, and the natural world is doing it for us right now” 2. Paul Ehrlich, a former science adviser to president George W. Bush and the author of “The Population Bomb”: “To our minds, the fundamental cure, reducing the scale of the human enterprise (including the size of the population) to keep its aggregate consumption within the carrying capacity of Earth is obvious but too much neglected or denied” 3. Paul Ehrlich again, this time on the size of families: “Nobody, in my view, has the right to have 12 children or even three unless the second pregnancy is twins”   …  6/36 4. Dave Foreman, the co-founder of Earth First: “We humans have become a disease, the Humanpox.” 5. CNN Founder Ted Turner: “A total world population of 250-300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal.” 6. Japan’s Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso about medical patients with serious illnesses:   …  7/36 “You cannot sleep well when you think it’s all paid by the government. This won’t be solved unless you let them hurry up and die.” 7. David Rockefeller: “The negative impact of population growth on all of our planetary ecosystems is becoming appallingly evident.”   …  8/36 8. Environmental activist Roger Martin: “On a finite planet, the optimum population providing the best quality of life for all, is clearly much smaller than the maximum, permitting bare survival. The more we are, the less for each; fewer people mean better lives.” 9. HBO personality Bill Maher:   …  9/36 “I’m pro-choice, I’m for assisted suicide, I’m for regular suicide, I’m for whatever gets the freeway moving – that’s what I’m for. It’s too crowded, the planet is too crowded and we need to promote death.” 10. MIT professor Penny Chisholm: “The real trick is, in terms of trying to level off at someplace lower than that 9 billion, is to get the birthrates in the developing countries to drop as fast as we can. And that will determine the level at which humans will level off on earth.” 11. Julia Whitty, a columnist for Mother Jones:   …  10/36 “The only known solution to ecological overshoot is to decelerate our population growth faster than it’s decelerating now and eventually reverse it—at the same time we slow and eventually reverse the rate at which we consume the planet’s resources. Success in these twin endeavors will crack our most pressing global issues: climate change, food scarcity, water supplies, immigration, health care, biodiversity loss, even war. ► Educate-Yourself: The Most Powerful Natural Painkiller That Works Like Morphine That You Can Make at Home.   …  11/36 On one front, we’ve already made unprecedented strides, reducing global fertility from an average 4.92 children per woman in 1950 to 2.56 today—an accomplishment of trial and sometimes brutally coercive error, but also a result of one woman at a time making her individual choices. The speed of this childbearing revolution, swimming hard against biological programming, rates as perhaps our greatest collective feat to date.” 12. Colorado State University Professor Philip Cafaro in a paper entitled “Climate Ethics and Population Policy”: “Ending human population growth is almost certainly a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for preventing catastrophic global climate change. Indeed, significantly reducing current human numbers may be necessary in order to do so.“   …  12/36 13. Professor of Biology at the University of Texas at Austin Eric R. Pianka: “I do not bear any ill will toward people. However, I am convinced that the world, including all humanity, WOULD clearly be much better off without so many of us.” 14. Detroit News Columnist Nolan Finley: “Since the national attention is on birth control, here’s my idea: If we want to fight poverty, reduce violent crime and bring down our embarrassing drop-out rate, we should swap contraceptives for fluoride in Michigan’s drinking water.   …  13/36 We’ve got a baby problem in Michigan. Too many babies are born to immature parents who don’t have the skills to raise them, too many are delivered by poor women who can’t afford them, and too many are fathered by sorry layabouts who spread their seed like dandelions and then wander away from the consequences.” 15. John Guillebaud, professor of family planning at University College London: “The effect on the planet of having one child less is an order of magnitude greater than all these other things we might do, such as switching off lights. An extra child is the equivalent of a lot of flights across the planet.” 16. Democrat strategist Steven Rattner:   …  14/36 “WE need death panels. Well, maybe not death panels, exactly, but unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently — rationing, by its proper name — the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget.” 17. Matthew Yglesias, a business and economics correspondent for Slate, in an article entitled “The Case for Death Panels, in One Chart”: “But not only is this health care spending on the elderly the key issue in the federal budget, our disproportionate allocation of health care dollars to old people surely accounts for the remarkable lack of apparent cost effectiveness of the American   …  15/36 health care system. When the patient is already over 80, the simple fact of the matter is that no amount of treatment is going to work miracles in terms of life expectancy or quality of life.” 18. Planned Parenthood Founder Margaret Sanger: “All of our problems are the result of overbreeding among the working class” 19. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg:   …  16/36 “Frankly I had thought that at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don’t want to have too many of.” 20. Planned Parenthood Founder Margaret Sanger: “The most merciful thing that the large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.” 21. Salon columnist Mary Elizabeth Williams in an article entitled “So What If Abortion   …  17/36 Ends Life?”: “All life is not equal. That’s a difficult thing for liberals like me to talk about, lest we wind up looking like death-panel-loving, kill-your-grandma-and-your-preciousbaby storm troopers. Yet a fetus can be a human life without having the same rights as the woman in whose body it resides.” Related: CLASSIFIED: The Criminal Global NWO Cabal Has Created Mass Global Dependency On The State – Microchipped Vaccines For Full Spectrum Dominance Of Humanity   …  18/36 22. Alberto Giubilini of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia and Francesca Minerva of the University of Melbourne in a paper published in the Journal of Medical Ethics: “[W]hen circumstances occur after birth such that they would have justified abortion, what we call after-birth abortion should be permissible. … [W]e propose to call this practice ‘after-birth abortion’, rather than ‘infanticide,’ to emphasize that the moral status of the individual killed is comparable with that of a fetus … rather than to that of a child. Therefore, we claim that killing a newborn could be ethically permissible in all the circumstances where abortion would be. Such circumstances include cases where the newborn has the potential to have an (at least) acceptable life, but the well-being of the family is at risk.” 23. Nina Fedoroff, a key adviser to Hillary Clinton:   …  19/36 “We need to continue to decrease the growth rate of the global population; the planet can’t support many more people.” 24. Barack Obama’s primary science adviser, John P. Holdren: “A program of sterilizing women after their second or third child, despite the relatively greater difficulty of the operation than vasectomy, might be easier to implement than trying to sterilize men.   …  20/36 The development of a long-term sterilizing capsule that could be implanted under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired opens additional possibilities for coercive fertility control. The capsule could be implanted at puberty and might be removable, with official permission, for a limited number of births.” 25. David Brower, the first Executive Director of the Sierra Club: “Childbearing [should be] a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license … All potential parents [should be] required to use   …  21/36 contraceptive chemicals, the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.” 26. Thomas Ferguson, former official in the U.S. State Department Office of Population Affairs: “There is a single theme behind all our work–we must reduce population levels. Either governments do it our way, through nice clean methods, or they will get the kinds of mess that we have in El Salvador, or in Iran or in Beirut. Population is a political problem. Once population is out of control, it requires authoritarian government, even fascism, to reduce it…” 27. Mikhail Gorbachev: “We must speak more clearly about sexuality, contraception, about abortion, about values that control population, because the ecological crisis, in short, is the population crisis. Cut the population by   …  22/36 90% and there aren’t enough people left to do a great deal of ecological damage.” 28. Jacques Costeau: “In order to stabilize world population, we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. It is a horrible thing to say, but it is just as bad not to say it.” 29. Finnish environmentalist Pentti Linkola: “If there were a button I could press, I would sacrifice myself without hesitating if it meant millions of people would die”   30.Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II and co-founder of the World Wildlife Fund: “In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus, in order to contribute something to solve overpopulation.” There is so much more that could be said about all of this. . . So what do you think about all of this? Do you agree or disagree with the sick population control agenda of the global elite?																
59	1	"The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine appears to be safe in people previously diagnosed with myocarditis, according to a small study presented Thursday at a European medical conference.  The findings, experts say, should help reassure people who previously experienced myocarditis that Covid vaccination is safe.  Myocarditis is an inflammatory heart condition with a number of causes, including viral and bacterial infections. The mRNA Covid vaccines, from both Pfizer and Moderna, have also been linked to a small but increased risk of the condition.   The new study was presented virtually at the European Society of Cardiology Acute CardioVascular Care conference. It has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, though it is undergoing peer review.  Researchers from France studied 55 patients, most of them young men, who had been hospitalized with myocarditis within the last five years and were later inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine.  Patients were contacted by the researchers by phone and asked if they had been vaccinated, with which vaccine, how many times and whether they experienced any side effects.  They found that none of the patients experienced myocarditis, or any other serious adverse event after vaccination, suggesting that the Pfizer vaccine is not associated with a risk of recurrence of the condition. Because the vast majority of the patients in the study were vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, the findings cannot be applied to other currently available Covid shots, such as Moderna’s, the authors noted.  The results may be reassuring to those with a history of myocarditis who are reluctant to get vaccinated.  ""One of causes pushing us to conduct this study was a patient with a history of prior myocarditis refusing to be vaccinated against Covid, fearing a recurrence,"" lead study author Dr. Abou Saleh, a researcher at Hospices Civils de Lyon, a hospital in France, told NBC News in an email.  The findings, he said, may ""incite patients with prior history of myocarditis to get vaccinated.""  Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak  The study comes less than two weeks after Florida's surgeon general formally recommended against Covid vaccinations for healthy children, citing in part the rare risk of myocarditis in young men and teenage boys. The state softened its stance a day later, however.  Both Pfizer’s and Moderna’s Covid vaccines have been linked to a slightly elevated risk of myocarditis, particularly in men ages 18 to 29 following their second dose.  In February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended people over the age of 12 and young men wait as long as eight weeks before receiving the second dose of the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccine as a possible means of reducing myocarditis risk.  Still, health experts note that the risk from vaccination remains very low, and most patients recover from the condition within a few days.  ""It tends to be much milder than what we typically see with traditional myocarditis, and there is a much more rapid recovery,"" said Dr. Katherine Poehling, a vaccine expert and pediatrician at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist in North Carolina.  She noted that the risk of severe complications from Covid is much greater than the risk of vaccine-induced myocarditis.  ""I don't think many people realize that Covid is a top 10 cause of death for children, which highlights this is something that is not benign in some children,"" Poehling said.  The study adds to overwhelming evidence that the Covid vaccines are safe, said Dr. Leslie Cooper, chair of the department of cardiology at Mayo Clinic.  Patients in the study reported common symptoms, such as fatigue and headache, after vaccination, according to the authors.  Cooper also said the findings could mean that the mechanisms that cause traditional myocarditis in people are different than those that can cause vaccine-induced myocarditis, though more research is needed.  “We do have lots of data on older forms of myocarditis, but very, very little data on vaccinated-associated myocarditis mechanisms,” he said."																
60	1	COVID vaccines have been available to adults in the United States for more than a year, but there are still a lot of questions. Which vaccines have received full approval? When will we see vaccines approved for children under the age of 5? And are there any new vaccines forthcoming?  To learn more, we talked with Julie Swann. Swann is a systems engineer with expertise in public health and issues related to contagious disease. In 2009, she served at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a science advisor for the H1N1 pandemic response. Swann is the department head and A. Doug Allison Distinguished Professor of the Fitts Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at NC State.  The Abstract: When people started getting COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., it was done under an emergency use authorization (EUA). Which vaccines have now received full approval?  Swann: This information is changing all the time. As of today, both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have received full approval from the FDA (respectively, for age 18 and up, and ages 16 and up). Just recently, Pfizer has added a request for full approval for adolescents age 12 to 15. One can find this information on websites from the FDA, the CDC, or news organizations, although it can be difficult to keep up with it.  TA: Does this mean that we have more data on how safe they are and how well they work?  Swann: We have a lot of data about the vaccine safety and effectiveness. Full approval (or, a Biologics License Application) has standards that are even higher than for emergency use, which already has requirements on safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality. The manufacturer submits additional data and analysis on potential safety events, distribution of the product, and studies after the EUA authorization. The FDA also does its own analysis of the vaccine for safety and effectiveness. For the EUA, we already had data from tens of thousands of participants who had received the vaccine, and now we have had it for millions and millions of doses in the U.S. and beyond.  TA: Where do things stand regarding vaccine approval for really young kids?  Swann: The Pfizer vaccine was approved for children aged 5 to 11 in October 2021. Many parents and caregivers are really looking forward to being able to vaccinate their younger children also. The Pfizer request for children under age 5 is currently anticipated in early April. This delay allowed Pfizer to give young children in the trial a third dose to increase effectiveness of the vaccine. We have not seen significant safety issues, but it appears a third dose is needed to ensure sufficient protection. Parents will need to hold on a little while longer, but this should also provide additional evidence that thorough reviews are being conducted.  TA: I saw that there's a new COVID-19 vaccine called Novavax coming out. How does it differ from the vaccines that have already been in use, like Moderna, Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson?  Swann: At a high level, the Moderna, Pfizer and J&J vaccines are all giving instructions to our cells to produce one of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, the spike protein. Our immune systems then learn to target that spike protein as foreign. When the SARS-CoV-2 virus hits us, the immune system is already prepared with the tools for defense. It attacks the spike protein and keeps you from getting sick, or at least from getting as sick as you would have if you weren't vaccinated.  The Novavax is similar to more traditional vaccines in its technology, but it works along similar lines as the described COVID-19 vaccines. The key difference is the Novavax vaccine is the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein itself, not the instructions for how to make it. It is just the protein—not a live or inactivated virus. The vaccine is relatively easy to distribute, because the cold chain requirements are not as strict as for the mRNA and adenovirus-vectored vaccines [such as the Moderna, Pfizer and J&J vaccines]. If someone is allergic to the mRNA vaccines, they may not be to the Novavax, as it does not contain polyethylene glycol [an ingredient used as a stabilizing agent in some COVID-19 vaccines]. It appears to be highly effective against all the variants we've seen so far.  (As a side note, the Novavax vaccine is made using moth cells to generate the protein and tree bark for an ingredient to boost immune response. There are other vaccines based on particles derived from tobacco plants. Nature is an amazing thing, and I think we will find the work on vaccines over the last couple of years will allow science to solve problems that we couldn't before.)  TA: Are there any other COVID vaccines forthcoming?  Swann: Absolutely! Some new vaccines will try to compete by having a lower price, while others may strive for a manufacturing and distribution system that scales worldwide, including in low-resource settings. There are also companies testing a vaccine in pill form and nasal sprays. This graphic by a media organization is an overall summary of vaccines in various stages. It can be hard to keep up with it all, especially since some vaccines have been tested and authorized in other countries that we are not using here. I am particularly interested in ones that can help make sure we vaccinate people around the globe, as in places like India there is still a long way to go. Longer term, researchers are trying to determine whether a vaccine could prevent severe disease not only from multiple variants, but even different types of coronaviruses. I also expect some of the technology will also advance our understanding of preventing other diseases. We should keep in mind that there are a number of diseases that kill many children (malaria) or affect the ability of humans to successfully reproduce (Zika), or cause lifelong effects (some tick-borne diseases). The advances in vaccine technology could also move forward treatments for cancer.

62	1	"The heads of some of America's largest professional health care associations are urging parents to get their children vaccinated against COVID-19, as part of a new advertising push by the Biden administration to persuade millions of families that have yet to do so.  The ads — a pair of 60-second spots titled ""Oath"" and ""Trust"" – feature pleas from Dr. Gerald Harmon, president of the American Medical Association; Dr. Moira Szilagyi, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics; Ernest Grant, president of the American Nurses Association; and Dr. Ada Stewart, chair of the board of the American Academy of Family Physicians.  Both spots are slated to run on social media as soon as Thursday, as well as on television screens starting next week.  ""We took an oath to do what's best for our patients. So we want you to know we trust the COVID vaccine. For ourselves, for our patients, for our kids. So should you,"" the group says in the ad.   The new ads come as the pace of new vaccinations has slowed nationwide for two straight months to record lows, even though more than 57 million eligible Americans are still unvaccinated. Only about three in 10 of all first doses given over the past two weeks were administered to children.  Compared to their vaccinated peers, CDC data through January suggests that rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations were three times higher in unvaccinated children 5-11 years old and two times higher in unvaccinated children 12-15 years old.  Recent studies published by the agency have found middling effectiveness from two shots against curbing urgent care visits or infections during the Omicron wave, though adolescents with a booster shot fared significantly better.  Pfizer and BioNTech are expected to have trial results in April that could allow for younger age groups to get a third dose.  The CDC also updated its guidance last month to allow for adolescents to extend the interval to as much as 8 weeks between their first and second dose, which some studies suggest may lower the risk of rare heart inflammation side effects and improve the vaccine's protection.  ""Like you, there's nothing more important to me than keeping our kids safe. What's not safe is getting COVID,"" the group says in the ad.  For months, federal health officials have touted their efforts to persuade hesitant families as the pool of children eligible for COVID-19 vaccines expanded.  The administration says an array of previous advertisements have reached 9 in 10 adults nationwide more than 20 times on average, citing data from Nielsen. Through programs like the ""COVID-19 Community Corps"" or millions of dollars awarded to organizations, the campaign has also tapped thousands of Americans to conduct outreach to promote the vaccine.  But more than four months since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first recommended the vaccine for children as young as five, just over a quarter of kids 5-11 years old have received both shots. Close to two-thirds of children 12-17 years old are fully vaccinated. The youngest of that group have been able to get the shots since last May.  ""Initially we thought that kids were pretty mildly impacted by COVID-19. And then as these new variants continued to emerge, we were seeing children that were dying. I was seeing that in my office, hospitalized families that were devastated,"" said Stewart.  Stewart, who works for a community health center in South Carolina, said she leapt at the opportunity a month ago to sit down in front of cameras in downtown Columbia for the advertising push in the hopes that it might persuade ""families that are on the fence.""  ""We continue to struggle with the fact that we still have a number of individuals who are not vaccinated. So hopefully this will encourage more to get vaccinated, entire families, children as well as the adults,"" Stewart said.  The latest data from CDC surveys suggest around 20% of parents will probably get their children vaccinated or are unsure. The share of parents who ""probably or definitely will not"" get the shots has climbed, up from 21% in October to 24%.  ""Accessing the vaccine is not an issue here in the state. You don't have to wait for your doctor to call you in,"" said Dr. José Romero, the head of the Arkansas Department of Health, ""but unfortunately, our immunization rates of children are, I'll put it, dismal.""  Recent reports from the CDC and Kaiser Family Foundation ranked many Southern states, including Arkansas, among the bottom half of jurisdictions in vaccinating children 5-11 years old.  Despite the plummeting pace of infections and hospitalizations in recent weeks, Romero said the state and their partners ""haven't slowed down at all"" in their own childhood COVID-19 vaccination initiatives, which also include paid advertising and outreach funded by Arkansas.  But efforts to persuade parents has proven challenging, given the initial reluctance of many parents themselves, he said, or unfounded reservations over its safety.  A survey from June 2021 found that 12.1% of parents who were hesitant to get vaccinated planned to have their children immunized after the shots became available. Since then, close to nine in 10 of all adults have now received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine.  Romero also blamed misinformation as a major driver in feeding fear of long-term side effects from the shots, as well as perceptions that kids were immune to severe outcomes from an infection.  ""Our parents and their reservations on taking the vaccine are going to be translated down to their children. And until parents see the need for this, that this is a serious disease, there is less of a drive to get that vaccine for the children,"" said Romero.  Data published by the CDC estimates that a little more than half of children have antibodies from a prior COVID-19 infection. 1,339 children have died.  A recent study from the United Kingdom, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, suggests that many adolescents who survive COVID-19 may end up with long-term symptoms. Romero cited other research that has linked COVID-19 to raising the risk of different health problems in children, like newly diagnosed diabetes.  ""This is a perfect opportunity to get it, while things are a little bit on the lull side, to get vaccinated. To go ahead and be protected just in case we have another variant that tries to rear its ugly head,"" said Stewart.  ""This is the time,"" Stewart added."																
63	1	"Pfizer and BioNTech have asked the Food and Drug Administration to greenlight a fourth dose of their COVID-19 vaccine for Americans 65 and older, the companies announced Tuesday, citing data from Israel suggesting that the additional booster could curb infections and severe illness in the highest-risk age group.  Pfizer working ""very diligently"" on vaccine to protect against all COVID variants, CEO says ""Right now, the way that we have seen, it is necessary, a fourth booster right now,"" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told ""Face the Nation"" in an interview that aired Sunday.   In a release on Tuesday, Pfizer and BioNTech pointed to an array of recently published studies as early evidence suggesting ""that effectiveness against both symptomatic COVID-19 and severe disease caused by Omicron wanes 3 to 6 months after receipt of an initial booster.""   ""The protection that you are getting from the third, it is good enough, actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths. It's not that good against infections,"" Bourla had said.  However, the companies say they have not formally submitted those studies for the FDA to consider. Instead, Pfizer and BioNTech said their request was based on ""two real-world data sets from Israel analyzed at a time when the Omicron variant was widely circulating.""   The companies say the additional booster for seniors should improve protection if given at least four months after their first booster.  In an analysis of records from the Israeli Ministry of Health, Pfizer and BioNTech say that rates of severe illness from COVID-19 ""were 4 times lower"" among people who got their second booster on that timeline.  Israel was one of the first countries to roll out fourth doses to vulnerable populations over the winter, as Omicron variant cases began to surge around the world.    The companies also say they studied antibodies drawn from 154 participants of a clinical trial in Israel who also got the additional dose on the same timeframe. Compared to antibodies drawn from people months after their initial booster, Pfizer and BioNTech say they saw a ""10-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies"" two weeks after the additional booster.  In a statement, FDA spokesperson Abby Capobianco said the agency had received the request and planned to review it ""as expeditiously as possible using our thorough and science based approach.""   The FDA also plans to convene a meeting of its outside panel of vaccine experts next month, Capobianco said, ""to have a transparent discussion about considerations for 2022 booster shots, including whether and when those boosters may be needed and for which populations, based on the available data and latest science on circulating or emerging virus variants.""  If soon authorized by the FDA and recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pfizer and BioNTech's request could accelerate a round of booster shots federal health officials had said they hoped might not be needed until the fall season, when many Americans get their routine influenza shots.   ""The hope would be that after our third shots we're able to get enough time out of them that we end up on essentially a yearly COVID-19 booster,"" Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA's top vaccines official, told an event hosted by the University of California San Francisco and Stanford University in January.  Executives at Moderna had echoed that timeline, telling investors last month they were racing to gather data on new COVID-19 vaccines for regulators to greenlight ahead of a potential ""fall booster season.""   Federal officials have also suggested it was possible only some vulnerable groups could be recommended to receive the fourth dose.  While data published by the CDC through January suggest rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths were lower among seniors with a booster, compared to the unvaccinated or those with only their primary, rates among all groups climbed during the Omicron wave to their highest levels in months.  ""It very likely will take into account what subset of people have a diminished, or not, protection against the important parameters such as hospitalization,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president's chief medical adviser, told reporters last month.  It is unclear if the Biden administration will be able to afford enough fourth doses. With a funding request stalled on Capitol Hill, the White House warned Tuesday that it would run out of money to buy future supplies of booster shots.  At least 16.5 million Americans 65 and older have received a booster shot four months ago and could be eligible for the additional booster, according to CDC data.   ""On the fourth shot, we have enough now for immunocompromised individuals who need to seek a fourth shot. What we don't have the funding for is if all Americans were needed to get an additional dose, we would need additional funding from Congress,"" a senior administration official told reporters."																
64	1	"(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.  Omicron linked with croup in babies  The Omicron variant of the coronavirus is causing a dramatic rise in cases of croup, a dangerous respiratory condition usually seen in babies and toddlers, new data suggest.  Croup, which causes a distinctive barking-like cough and high-pitched sounds when patients inhale, happens when viruses cause swelling in the respiratory tract that makes it hard to breathe. From the start of the pandemic until mid-January 2022, emergency physicians at Boston Children's Hospital treated 75 children with croup, all but one of whom had COVID infections. Eighty percent of those cases occurred after Omicron began circulating in December 2021, they reported in Pediatrics. Most of the children were treated with steroids and sent home, but some required hospitalization. Overall, the children required more medication doses compared to children with croup caused by other viruses, the doctors found.  ""There was a very clear delineation from when Omicron became the dominant variant to when we started seeing a rise in the number of croup patients,"" study leader Dr. Ryan Brewster said in a statement. While many viruses can cause croup, parents should be aware of the possibility that a child with croup has COVID-19 and consider having them and other family members tested, the researchers advised.  Most people will experience bloating from time to time and while it's discomforting, chances are it's nothing to worry about. However, if it's a common occurrence it could indicate a bigger problem you should speak to your physician about. Eat This, Not That!

Read on—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had COVID. Tuberculosis vaccine improves immune response to coronavirus  New research sheds light on how a tuberculosis vaccine might help protect against COVID-19.  Early in the pandemic, studies began to suggest that people who received the so-called BCG vaccine as children had lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Research in hamsters now shows that animals vaccinated with BCG had less pneumonia due to COVID-19 and lower levels of the coronavirus in their lungs. Doctors at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore found important differences in lung cells between animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 who did or did not get the BCG vaccine, they reported on Tuesday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. Upon infection with the coronavirus, for the BCG-treated animals, antibodies came to lung cells much faster, lung repair mechanisms got underway much more quickly, and tissue-damaging inflammation was blunted, said coauthor Dr. William Bishai. Earlier this month, researchers in India reported on the effects of BCG in recipients of the COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca in a small study. The 21 subjects who had received the TB vaccine showed significantly ""more robust"" antibody- and T-cell attacks against the coronavirus than the 13 people who had not, they reported on Research Square ahead of peer review. Combining BCG vaccines with COVID-19 vaccines ""may offer synergistic protection,"" the Johns Hopkins team said. Clinical trials testing BCG vaccines for protection against COVID-19 are underway.  Critically ill COVID patients slow to wake after ventilator  Compared to how quickly an average patient ""wakes up"" after being taken off a mechanical ventilator, critically ill COVID-19 patients often take much longer to regain consciousness, researchers have found.  They reviewed data on 795 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 at three medical centers during the first two surges of the pandemic. All were on mechanical ventilation for at least six days, during which they were comatose. After removal from respiratory support, 72% eventually regained consciousness, but 25% of them needed at least 10 days to wake up, and 10% needed 23 days or more to recover. Patients who had experienced the most episodes of oxygen deprivation took the longest to recover consciousness, the researchers reported in Annals of Neurology.  ""Our findings suggest that for patients with severe COVID, the decision to withdraw life support shouldn't be based solely on prolonged periods of unconsciousness, as these patients may eventually recover,"" Dr. Jan Claassen of New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center said in statement. ""These findings provide us with more accurate information to guide families who are deciding whether to continue life-sustaining therapy in unconscious COVID-19 patients,"" Classen's colleague, Dr. Brian Edlow of the Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a statement."																
65	1	"Pfizer and BioNTech submitted an application to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization of an additional booster dose of their Covid-19 vaccine for adults 65 and older who have gotten a booster dose of any of the authorized or approved vaccine, the companies said Tuesday.  Children 12-15 years old receive a Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster at Hartford Hospital in Hartford, Connecticut on January 6, 2022. The submission is based on two data sets from Israel. ""Both data sets showed evidence that an additional mRNA booster increases immunogenicity and lowers rates of confirmed infections and severe illness,"" the companies said in a news release.  The first data set cited in the release was an analysis of records for more than 1.1 million adults 60 and older by the Israeli Ministry of Health that showed a decreased rate of infection and severe illness after a second booster.  The participants had no known history of Covid-19 and were eligible for an additional booster. ""These data showed rates of confirmed infections were 2 times lower and rates of severe illness were 4 times lower among individuals who received an additional booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine administered at least four months after an initial booster (third) dose compared to those who received only one booster dose,"" the news release says.  That research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a professional journal.  The second data set is the result of an ongoing trial looking at health care workers 18 and older who had gotten three doses of Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine. Those findings were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Of 700 participants, 154 received an additional Pfizer/BioNTech booster at least four months after their third dose. The fourth dose was safe and boosted antibody levels similar to what was seen after a third dose but didn't appear any more effective at preventing Omicron infection.  The companies said this additional booster did not result in any new safety concerns.  Although not included in the EUA submission, the companies referenced other ""emerging evidence"" that could support the need for an additional booster. ""These early studies indicate that an additional booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine administered at least 4 months after an initial booster dose could restore antibody titers to peak post-third dose titer levels, improve protection against both infection and severe disease in individuals 60 years of age and older in Israel, and have a similar safety profile to that of previous doses.""  The FDA said it will review Pfizer and BioNTech's request ""as expeditiously as possible using our thorough and science-based approach.""  The agency also said it will convene its independent vaccine advisers, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, in April ""to have a transparent discussion about considerations for 2022 booster shots, including whether and when those boosters may be needed and for which populations, based on the available data and latest science on circulating or emerging virus variants."" A date for the meeting has not been set.  Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said Sunday that he expects that a fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccine will be needed.  ""It is necessary -- a fourth boost for right now. The protection we are getting from the third, it is good enough -- actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths -- is not that good against infections, but doesn't last very long,"" Bourla said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""But we are just submitting those data to the FDA, and then we'll see what the experts also would say outside Pfizer.""  A few countries area already offering fourth doses of Covid-19 vaccines.  In the United States, only certain immunocompromised adults can receive three doses of the coronavirus vaccine and a fourth shot as a booster dose.  Two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine are available for people 5 and older, and people 12 and older are eligible to receive a booster five months after their second shot."																
66	1	To help fend off another wave of Covid-19, people will need a fourth dose of vaccine, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CBS on Sunday.  “Many variants are coming, and Omicron was the first one that was able to evade — in a skillful way — the immune protection that we’re giving,” Bourla told CBS’ “Face the Nation.”  “The protection we are getting from the third (dose) it is good enough — actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths,” Bourla said.  But protection after three doses is “not that good against infections” and “doesn’t last very long” when faced with a variant like Omicron.  “It is necessary, a fourth (dose) for right now,” Bourla told CBS.  Currently, anyone ages 12 and up who got a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine at least five months ago can get a third dose.  Anyone ages 18 and up who got the two-dose Moderna vaccine should get a booster shot six months after the second dose, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  And anyone who got the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine should get a booster shot after two months, the CDC said.  Some moderately or severely immunocompromised people who have had three doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna Covid-19 vaccines can already get a fourth dose of vaccine, according to the CDC.  But it’s not clear if or when the US Food and Drug Administration might authorize a fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccine for healthy teens and adults.  “We are just submitting those data to the FDA, and then we’ll see what the experts also would say outside Pfizer,” Bourla told CBS.  Kids under 5 might soon be able to get vaccinated Currently, children ages 5 to 11 are eligible for two pediatric doses of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine but are not yet eligible for a booster. Pfizer is testing a third dose in that age group now.  And kids under age 5 are not yet eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine — though that could change this spring, Bourla said.  Initial trial data in children ages 2 to 5 showed two doses of a smaller, child-sized vaccine didn’t give the expected immunity in the 2- to 5-year-olds — though it did for babies ages 6 months to 2 years.  So Pfizer decided to add a third child-sized dose for children under age 5 in its ongoing trial.  Pfizer should have data on its three-dose vaccine trial for children ages 6 months to 5 years by April, Bourla told CBS on Sunday.  If authorized by the FDA and recommended by the CDC, Covid-19 vaccines for children ages 6 months to 5 years might start as early as May, Bourla said.  A shot at a longer-lasting vaccine against all variants Pfizer and Moderna have said they are working on a vaccine that would specifically protect against the Omicron variant. It’s not clear yet if one is needed.																
67	1	Researchers say the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are safe for people with compromised immune systems. They say the two mRNA-based vaccines produced relatively few side effects in people who are immunocompromised. Experts encourage people with compromised immune systems to get their full allotment of COVID-19 vaccines. They add that family and friends of those who are at high risk should also be fully vaccinated. Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are well tolerated by people with impaired immunity.  A new study concludes that the two mRNA-based vaccines produced relatively few side effects in people who are immunocompromised due to cancers, rheumatological, or neurological conditions.  “Strikingly, we found that the occurrence of adverse events in these high-risk patients is comparable to that reported in vaccine trials conducted in the general population,” said Nicola Silvestris, PhD, a senior author of the study and a researcher at the University of Bari Aldo Moro, Italy, in a press release.  “Our patients did not show a higher incidence of severe adverse events and we did not see an increased risk of discontinuation of treatment programs due to vaccination,” Silvestris added. “Therefore, vaccination for COVID-19 is confirmed as safe, even in this group of high-risk patients.”  Dr. Dean Blumberg, the chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of California Davis, says while the results aren’t surprising, the research still provides positive news.  “It’s an expected result, but it’s always reassuring to have the data because we’ve been surprised so many times during this pandemic when things didn’t turn out as expected,” Blumberg told Healthline.  “With most vaccines, people who are immunocompromised have similar reactions, compared to those who are immune-competent for vaccines which are non-live,” he said. “And, of course, the mRNA vaccines are not live vaccines… so they would be expected to have a similar side effects profile in immune-compromised compared to immune-competent populations.”  Higher risks People who are immunocompromised are at higher risk of complications due to COVID-19, but those in this category may also be concerned about vaccine side effects.  Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, says it’s been understandable that some people who are immunocompromised may feel hesitant about getting the COVID-19 vaccine.  “It is quite an appropriate concern,” Schaffner told Healthline. “For example, there are organ transplant recipients who receive immune suppressive medications, and they are concerned that a substantial immunological stimulus, such as a vaccine, might… initiate a reaction that would reject the graft, the transplant.”  “No evidence for that exists,” he said. “It was a concern among the professionals as well as patients who received it. But all the data indicate, very fortunately, that that’s not the case.”  The efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine varies considerablyTrusted Source among people who are immunocompromised, and Blumberg says this is made all the more complicated by variants and sub-variants.  “We already know that… the vaccines don’t protect as well against Omicron compared to Delta,” he said. “This would be exaggerated in an immune-compromised population.”  “Then when we get the sub-variants of Omicron, the BA.2 sub-variant, this appears to be even more infectious,” Blumberg added. “This provides an additional risk for those who are immune-compromised and really emphasizes the need for an adequate immune response.”   When to get the shots The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adviseTrusted Source that anyone 12 years or older who’s moderately or severely immunocompromised should receive four doses of the COVID-19 vaccination.  Three of these doses are given as primary doses, and the fourth is given as a booster at least 3 months after the third shot.  Children ages 5 to 11 who are immunocompromised should receive three primary doses of the Pfizer vaccine. The second dose should take place 21 days after the first dose, and the third dose should be given 28 days after the second dose.  Schaffner says these additional doses are important in keeping immunocompromised people safe, but those around immunocompromised people also have an important role to play.  “Immunocompromised people clearly are at increased risk of more severe disease,” he said. “Therefore, this attention we devote to them is completely justified. The recommendation continues to be that not only should the immunocompromised person be vaccinated, but everyone around them should be vaccinated to create what has been called a cocoon of protection around that person.”  “In other words, it just makes it harder for the COVID virus to get through all those people well protected… to actually get through and infect the person at greatest risk,” he added.																
68	1	"THURSDAY, March 17, 2022 (HealthDay News) -- In a finding that reinforces the safety of COVID vaccines, a new study shows that while the shots don't raise the risk of rare neurological problems, COVID-19 infection might.  The researchers focused on four immune-related neurological disorders: Bell's palsy (facial weakness), encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord), Guillain-Barré syndrome (a nerve condition), and transverse myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord).  The investigators analyzed data on 8.3 million people in the United Kingdom and Spain who received at least one dose of either the AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines and nearly 736,000 unvaccinated people who tested positive for COVID-19.  Data on 14.3 million people in the general population that was gathered before the pandemic was also reviewed, to estimate historical background rates of the four disorders.  Rates of the disorders were measured in the 21 days after the first vaccine dose, 90 days after a positive COVID-19 test, and between 2017 and 2019 in the general population group.  Overall, rates after vaccination were consistent with expected general population rates for Bell's palsy, encephalomyelitis and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Rates of transverse myelitis were rare (less than five events in all vaccinated groups), so could not be analyzed.  But rates of Bell's palsy, encephalomyelitis and Guillain-Barré syndrome were higher than expected after COVID-19 infection, according to the study published March 16 in the BMJ.  ""We found no safety signal for any of the studied immune-mediated neurological events after vaccination against COVID-19,"" said study authors led by Daniel Prieto-Alhambra, from the Centre for Statistics in Medicine in the Nuffield Department of Orthopedics, Rheumatology, and Musculoskeletal Sciences at the University of Oxford.  ""Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was, however, associated with an increased risk of Bell's palsy, encephalomyelitis and Guillain-Barré syndrome,"" they said in a journal news release.  In response to reports that some people developed Guillain-Barré syndrome after receiving the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines, the European Medicines Agency listed Guillain-Barré syndrome as a rare side effect of the vaccines.  ""We may never be able to tell exactly what caused an individual to develop a neurological condition, but COVID-19 vaccination is a highly unlikely reason for most,"" the authors concluded."																
69	1	Hundreds of Millions of People Have Safely Received a COVID-19 Vaccine  More than 557 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine had been given in the United States from December 14, 2020, through March 14, 2022. To view the current total number of COVID-19 vaccinations that have been administered in the United States, please visit the CDC COVID Data Tracker.  COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials. The vaccines met the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization (EUA). Learn more about EUAs in this video.external icon  The Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID-19 vaccines will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in US history. This monitoring includes using both established and new safety monitoring systems to make sure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe.  Common Side Effects After COVID-19 vaccination, some people may feel ill, with symptoms like fever or tiredness for a day or two after receiving the vaccine. These symptoms are normal and are signs that the body is building immunity. Some people have no side effects. Others have reported common side effects after COVID-19 vaccination, such as:  Swelling, redness, and pain at the injection site Fever Headache Tiredness Muscle pain Chills Nausea Serious Safety Problems Are Rare In rare cases, people have experienced serious health events after COVID-19 vaccination. Any health problem that happens after vaccination is considered an adverse event. An adverse event can be caused by the vaccine or can be caused by a coincidental event not related to the vaccine.  To date, the systems in place to monitor the safety of these vaccines have found four serious types of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination, with evidence that suggests a link to certain types of COVID-19 vaccinations that were administered. They are:  Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a severe type of allergic reaction with symptoms such as hives, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, or significant swelling of the tongue or lips. Anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination is rare. Learn more about COVID-19 vaccines and allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.  Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) is a rare but serious adverse event that causes blood clots or issues with clotting. TTS after COVID-19 vaccination is rare. Learn more about COVID-19 vaccines and adverse events, including TTS.  Myocarditis and Pericarditis Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis is inflammation of the outer lining of the heart. Myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. Learn more about COVID-19 vaccines and adverse events, including myocarditis and pericarditis.  Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a rare disorder where the body’s immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. GBS after COVID-19 vaccination is rare. Learn more about COVID-19 vaccines and adverse events, including GBS.  Reports of Death Are Rare Reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)external icon, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem.   More than 557 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through March 14, 2022. During this time, VAERS received 13,273 preliminary reports of death (0.0024%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC clinicians review reports of death to VAERS including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records.  A review of reports indicates a causal relationship between Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and TTS. On December 16, 2021, CDC scientists released a comprehensive reviewpdf icon of reported U.S. cases through December 2, 2021. Continued monitoring has identified additional deaths for a total of nine deaths causally associated with Johnson & Johnson Janssen COVID-19 vaccination. CDC and FDA continue to review reports of death following COVID-19 vaccination and update information as it becomes available.  Benefits of Vaccination Outweigh the Risks Serious side effects that could cause a long-term health problem are extremely unusual following any vaccination, including COVID-19 vaccination. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks.  CDC continues to closely monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Everyone who receives a COVID-19 vaccine can also participate in safety monitoring by enrolling themselves, their children ages five years and older, or other dependents in a smartphone app called v-safe and completing health check-ins after COVID-19 vaccination.																
70	1	Over the past year, results from a series of clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing serious illness, hospitalizations, and deaths.  Yet, with sporadic reports of rare adverse events, one question has remained unanswered: Just how safe are COVID-19 vaccines in the real world, outside of clinical trials?  Get more HMS news here  Now, a study published Aug. 25 in The New England Journal of Medicine by researchers from Clalit Research Institute in Israel, Harvard Medical School, and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health answers that question.  The research, which assessed the safety of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, is based on analysis of data from nearly 2 million individuals in Israel and represents one of the largest real-world assessments of COVID-19 vaccine safety to date.  The findings, the researchers said, affirm the overall safety of the vaccine and underscore that the risk of adverse consequences from actual infection with SARS-CoV-2 far outweighs potential vaccine risks.  The study involved two analyses: A comparison of adverse events between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and between unvaccinated people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and unvaccinated noninfected people.  The study showed that few adverse events were associated with the vaccine. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, the most serious of them, was rare, with a rate of 2.7 excess cases per 100,000 vaccinated people. This means that for every 100,000 individuals, 2.7 more cases of myocarditis occurred than would be expected, the researchers said.  By contrast, the risk of myocarditis was notably higher among infected but unvaccinated individuals, occurring at a rate of 11 excess cases per 100,000 people.  Coronavirus infection—but not vaccination—was also associated with greatly increased risk of pericarditis (an inflammation of the area around the heart), heart arrhythmias, heart attacks, strokes, pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, acute kidney damage, among others.  Vaccine hesitancy “To date, one of the main drivers of vaccine hesitancy has been a lack of information regarding potential side effects of the vaccine,” said study co-author Ben Reis, HMS assistant professor of pediatrics at Boston Children’s Hospital and director of the predictive medicine group in the Computational Health Informatics Program at Boston Children’s.  “This careful epidemiological study provides reliable information on vaccine safety, which we hope will be helpful to those who have not yet decided about vaccination,” Reis said.   “Those who have hesitated until now to get vaccinated due to concerns about very rare side effects, such as myocarditis, should be aware that the risks for this very same side effect are actually higher among unvaccinated infected individuals,” Reis said.  The results are based on records from Clalit Health Services in Israel, one of the world’s largest integrated health record databases. The analysis is the largest peer-reviewed evaluation of the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine in a nationwide mass-vaccination setting.              “The extensive nationwide rollout of Israel’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign provided the Clalit Research Institute with a unique opportunity to assess, through its rich and comprehensive digital datasets, the safety of the vaccine in a real-world setting, without needing to rely on individual-driven active reporting of side effects” said study senior author Ran Balicer, director of the Clalit Research Institute and Chief Innovation Officer for Clalit.  “These results show convincingly that this mRNA vaccine is very safe and that the alternative of ‘natural’ morbidity caused by the coronavirus puts a person at significant, higher, and much more common risk of serious adverse events,” Balicer said.  The results of this real-world study confirm, complement, and build on the previously reported findings of the Pfizer/BioNTech phase 3 randomized clinical trial, which involved 21,720 individuals, the researchers noted.  The comprehensive nature of this new analysis and the sheer volume of data involved offer a more detailed assessment of the vaccine’s safety across a wider range of adverse events.  “These data should facilitate informed individual risk-benefit decision-making, and, in our view, make a strong argument in favor of opting in to get vaccinated, especially in countries where the virus is currently widespread,” added Balicer, who also serves as chairman of Israel’s National Expert Advisory Team on COVID-19 response.  Previous efforts to characterize vaccine safety have relied on voluntary active reporting by vaccinated individuals, known to be incomplete. The new study relies on the analysis of millions of anonymized electronic medical records, which are far more comprehensive.  Parallel analyses In an effort to provide the proper context that is critical for interpreting vaccine safety findings, the researchers also examine a wide range of adverse events both among vaccinated individuals and among unvaccinated individuals who were infected with the coronavirus, conducting two parallel analyses, assessing the occurrence of 25 adverse events in each of these groups.  In the vaccinated subgroup, the researchers compared the outcomes of 884,828 vaccinated individuals 16 years and older with those of 884,828 unvaccinated individuals based on an extensive set of sociodemographic, geographic, and health-related characteristics.  This analysis took place from Dec. 20, 2020, the launch of Israel’s national vaccination campaign, through May 24, 2021.  Some individuals switched groups based on their changing vaccination status, with 235,541 people moving from the unvaccinated group into the vaccinated group during the study.  To provide context for the vaccine safety findings above, a separate analysis was conducted among unvaccinated individuals. This analysis estimated rates of the same 25 potential adverse events among 173,106 unvaccinated individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, compared with 173,106 carefully matched controls not infected with SARS-CoV-2.  This analysis took place from March 1, 2020, the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, through May 24, 2021.  The vaccine was found to be safe: Out of 25 potential side effects examined. four were found to have a link with the vaccine.  Myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle associated with the vaccine was rare—2.7 excess cases per 100,000 vaccinated individuals. These events were observed mainly among males between the ages of 20 and 34.  In contrast, myocarditis was far more common among unvaccinated individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. The analysis showed 11 excess cases of myocarditis per 100,000 infected individuals.  Other adverse events moderately associated with vaccination were swelling of the lymph nodes, a mild side effect that is part of a standard immune response to vaccination, with 78 excess cases per 100,000, appendicitis with 5 excess cases per 100,000, likely as a result of swelling of lymph nodes around the appendix.  Reactivation of dormant herpes zoster (chickenpox virus) infection occurred in 16 cases per 100,000.  Unvaccinated risks These small numbers of adverse events among vaccinated individuals stood in stark contrast with the high rate of multiple and more serious adverse events among unvaccinated individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.  These included cardiac arrhythmias (a 3.8-fold increase above baseline risk with 166 cases per 100,000 infected patients); kidney damage (14.8-fold increase with 125 excess cases per 100,000); pericarditis (5.4-fold increase with 11 excess cases per 100,000); pulmonary embolism (12.1-fold increase with 62 excess cases per 100,000); deep-vein thrombosis, or a blood clot in the veins (3.8-fold increase with 43 excess cases per 100,000); myocardial infarction, or heart attack (4.5-fold increase with 25 excess cases per 100,000); and stroke (2.1-fold increase with 14 excess cases per 100,000).  Additional investigators on the study included Noam Barda, Noa Dagan, Yair Ben-Shlomo, Eldad Kepten, Jacob Waxman, Reut Ohana, all of the Clalit Research Institute; Doron Netzer of Clalit Health Services; Miguel Hernán and Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health; and Isaac Kohane of Harvard Medical School.  The research was funded in part by the newly announced Ivan and Francesca Berkowitz Family Living Laboratory Collaboration at Harvard Medical School and Clalit Research Institute.																
71	1	"Spare a thought for patients with impaired immunity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their condition puts them at high risk of severe complications from COVID-19, but also creates uncertainty about the safety and effectiveness of the available vaccines that could protect them.  A new study in Frontiers in Oncology helps to put this catch-22 situation to rest by finding that two popular mRNA-based vaccines are well tolerated by such high-risk patients. The trial found that the vaccines were safe and did not cause unexpected adverse events in a group of patients with various cancers, neurological, and rheumatological conditions that are associated with immunosuppression. The results will reassure vaccine-hesitant patients that the vaccines are safe, even for the immunocompromised.  By now, many of us have received a COVID-19 vaccine, including those based on new mRNA technology, and this has allowed society to largely reopen in many countries. Vaccine-mediated protection, along with the rise of the milder Omicron variant, means that the number of COVID-19 patients with severe disease has dropped significantly over the past year. However, it hasn't been plain sailing for everyone.  The original clinical trials for these vaccines were conducted in healthy volunteers. While this is standard practice, it means that high-risk immunocompromised patients, such as those taking immunosuppressant drugs for neurological conditions, were not included in the trials.  Previous catch-22 for immunocompromised patients  This lack of trial data could lead such patients to be understandably hesitant about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. However, in a cruel irony, they are also at high risk of severe COVID-19 complications, suggesting that they would greatly benefit from vaccine-mediated protection. In an effort to cast more light on the safety of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, a group of researchers in Italy conducted a study to assess COVID-19 vaccine safety in high-risk patients.  The researchers enrolled 566 high-risk patients in the trial, and administered two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine as normal. The patients reported any adverse events in a questionnaire, and the questions focused on the first week after each dose.  The most common reported side-effects at the injection site included pain, swelling, and a rash, whereas the most common general side-effects included tiredness, headache, chills and muscle pain. Such side-effects are also commonly reported by people with a fully functioning immune system who have received the vaccine. The study also found no evidence that the underlying disease of the patients was affected, and vaccination did not interfere with the patient's ability to undergo standard treatment for their conditions.  No higher incidence of adverse events in high-risk patients  ""Strikingly, we found that the occurrence of adverse events in these high-risk patients is comparable to that reported in vaccine trials conducted in the general population,"" explained Prof Nicola Silvestris of the University of Bari Aldo Moro, Italy, the senior author.  ""Our patients did not show a higher incidence of severe adverse events and we did not see an increased risk of discontinuation of treatment programs due to vaccination. Therefore, vaccination for COVID-19 is confirmed as safe, even in this group of high-risk patients.""  The results will help to calm fears among immunocompromised patients who are at high risk of severe COVID-19 complications, but are also worried about the side-effects of the vaccine.  ""Our main recommendation based on the results of this study is that vaccination for COVID-19 is strongly recommended and the safety profile is reassuring,"" said Dr. Maria Teresa Lupo-Stanghellini of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Italy, lead author on the study.  ""Our ongoing safety monitoring of the COVID-19 vaccine continues in the spirit of offering the best prevention and care for our patients."""																
72	1	"Additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine are recommended for immunocompromised patients, especially for organ transplant recipients who are least able to make antibodies to fight off coronavirus, say experts in The BMJ today.  The findings reinforce the importance of additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine to protect people with a weakened immune system.  It is already known that after vaccination, people with a weakened immune system (immunocompromised) are less able to make antibodies to fight off viruses, such as influenza, than people with a healthy immune system (immunocompetent). But less is known about the response to COVID-19 vaccines, particularly mRNA vaccines.  The process of making antibodies after infection or vaccination—priming the immune system to fight off a specific virus—is called seroconversion.  To address this knowledge gap, researchers in Singapore analyzed the results of 82 observational studies comparing the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised and immunocompetent people.  Of these studies, 77 (94%) used mRNA vaccines, 16 (20%) viral vector vaccines, and 4 (5%) inactivated whole virus vaccines. A total of 63 studies were assessed to be at low risk of bias and 19 at moderate risk of bias.  After one COVID-19 vaccine dose, seroconversion was found to be reduced among immunocompromised groups, except people with HIV.  Seroconversion rates were about half as likely in patients with blood cancers, immune mediated inflammatory disorders (eg. rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis) and solid (tumor) cancers compared with immunocompetent controls, whereas organ transplant recipients were 16 times less likely to seroconvert.  After a second dose, seroconversion was significantly increased in patients with blood cancers, immune mediated inflammatory disorders and solid cancers, but remained severely reduced in transplant recipients, with only a third achieving seroconversion.  Further review of 11 studies showed that a third dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was associated with seroconversion among vaccine non-responders with solid cancers, blood cancers, and immune mediated inflammatory disorders, although response was variable in transplant recipients and no published evidence was available on the effectiveness of a third dose in people with HIV.  Among the immunocompromised groups studied, antibody levels (titres) were also lower than in immunocompetent controls.  The researchers point to several limitations. For example, the included studies were observational and used different definitions of seroconversion. What's more, the researchers cannot rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors, such as age and underlying conditions, might have affected their results.  Nevertheless, use of stringent study inclusion criteria together with rigorous and systematic evaluation of study quality suggests their conclusions are robust.  As such, they say their findings show that seroconversion rates and antibody titres after COVID-19 vaccines are significantly lower in immunocompromised patients, especially organ transplant recipients.  ""Targeted interventions for immunocompromised patients, including a third dose, should be performed,"" they conclude."																
73	1	I’ve started seeing alarmist articles about the vaccine killing or harming people. I have friends and family who refuse to take it. I want to reassure them that it’s safe. It gave me no side effects besides a sore arm. But I also want to be sure I’m telling them the right thing, so I dug into this issue. This post covers a few topics: I explain why alarmist claims like “25,000 vaccine deaths” are not true. I look into VAERS deaths, and whether there is a safety signal there. I look at some other vaccine side effects and compare these to the risks from getting covid. I give some suggestions for who should get vaccinated and which vaccine is the safest. Steve Kirsch makes some of the most extreme claims about vaccine safety. In June, he said that the covid vaccine has killed 25,000 people in America. He linked to a blog post by Austin G. Walters, presenting the evidence:  Austin Walter’s argument is that there’s been a recent increase in uncategorized deaths, the CDC lists them in the R00-R99 category: “Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified”:  R00-R99 deaths per week, 2020 through 2021 This cause is killing thousands of people in America every week. Austin assumes that these must all be covid vaccine deaths, concludes that the vaccine has killed 25,000 people and clearly, the government must be covering up the whole damn thing. I’ll admit, reading that blog post scared me. 25,000 deaths, someone should be looking into this! Are the authorities lying to us? After a bit more thought, I realized that these are uncategorized deaths. Maybe there’s just some time lag in how they determine cause of death? I looked for older copies of the data. Here’s a snapshot from July 2020, it also showed a spike last summer:  Here are periodic snapshots of the data (courtesy of @Piercedgeek)  Okay, so R00-R99 is actually just miscellaneous deaths that have not yet been categorized. It’s a placeholder that gets changed as the true source of death has been determined. There is no recent spike of mysterious deaths. It always takes the CDC about 8 weeks to classify how people died. If a large number of people had died from the covid vaccine, you would see a spike in the graph of all deaths:  Looking at the last few years, we see the 2018 flu season. We see 3 waves of covid deaths. We don’t see any big spike of vaccine deaths. Steve says this should show up in April and May 2021. Deaths in America actually went back to the normal average in April, after being very high through the whole covid pandemic:  That graph is a little bit noisy. Here’s another way to look at it:  Data compiled and graphed by hmatejx People died in the US (black line) while covid deaths were high (red line) but not while vaccines were being given out (blue line). We can see the effect of vaccinations even more clearly in other countries that had less covid cases. Australia has made it through the covid pandemic with very few cases, there was only one wave of cases near Melbourne. Total deaths in Australia actually went down in 2020 during the lockdowns. Since the death rate is consistent over time, we should be able to see a big spike of deaths when the vaccinations begin. In reality, nothing much happened:  If the vaccine is as deadly as people like Steve Kirsch think, there would be a very clear spike in deaths reported in February 2021. The same thing can be seen in other low covid countries like New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, and South Korea. The vaccine just isn’t dangerous enough to kill tens of thousands of people. Steve Kirsch got in a 5 hour debate about vaccine safety. Debate about the R00-R99 issue starts 10 minutes in and ends around 36 minutes. Austin Walters quickly issued a correction to his blog post, after seeing this problem. Steve Kirsch took 25 minutes of debate to concede. He blamed Austin for getting this wrong. He said he had never heard this objection (I sent it to him on Twitter, other people sent it to him on TrialSiteNews). He finally gave a concession that this claim probably isn’t true. He did not update his own writing or videos, and continued to tell people that the vaccine is causing mass casualties. Rather than learning from this mistake, Steve went on to find another bad argument, and now says that 150,000 people have died. It should be obvious that’s wrong, because that would show up in the excess deaths in the US and other countries. It would be hard to hide that many deaths. To be thorough, I’ve also debunked that claim, and also came up with a theory for why Steve believes the strange things that he does. Fake news travels faster than the truth. Steve’s posts will scare a lot of people and my rebuttals won’t reassure as many. I might as well debunk them anyways. The vaccine has not killed 25,000 people. Pfizer’s trial showed the vaccine is not deadly for most people Could there be a smaller number of vaccine deaths that are going unreported? How bad could the vaccine be, before anyone noticed? We can look at Pfizer’s phase 3 trials. The trials vaccinated 22,000 people and kept 22,000 as a control group. With that size, you can see risks as small as 1 in 22,000. The trials did detect a possible risk that the vaccine gives some people Bell’s palsy, with odds around 1 in 10,000. During the Pfizer trials, 2 people died, among 22,000 that were vaccinated. One person had a heart attack 60 days after the second dose, I’d imagine that’s unrelated. One person died 3 days after the first dose. Pfizer says the death was unrelated. But the timing is suspicious, to be on the safe side I’m going to go with, “let’s say it could be vaccine related”. Having 2 people die in the experiment is not suspicious. 4 people died in the control group, among people who didn’t get the vaccine. One conspiracy theorist asks, “why did Pfizer use a deadly placebo to hide the vaccine deaths?” If you pick a random sample of 22,000 Americans, about 4 should die every week, for reasons unrelated to the vaccine. It’s hard to see the signal in the noise. Suppose the vaccine has some rare side effects, and it happens to kill 1 person out of 100,000. The phase 3 trial would never notice those effects. The covid vaccine is an experiment. We’re giving a brand new drug to hundreds of millions of people. Pfizer doesn’t know what will happen. No one does. We have to monitor the situation and see. The best we can say from the trial is that the risks are at most 1 in 22,000 for the population they studied. We’ve vaccinated 160 million people so far. That would put an upper limit on vaccine deaths around 7,000. One caveat is that the rate of death (from all causes) among trial participants is lower than in the population at large. The Pfizer trial group is younger and healthier than the average American, it doesn’t include nursing home residents or terminally ill patients. If the vaccine were deadly to some very unhealthy population, the trial wouldn’t find that. To see the effects on the oldest people, we have to monitor it with tools like VAERS. How serious are VAERS deaths? 6,000 deaths were recorded in VAERS, the US government’s tracking system for vaccine deaths and side effects. Every time someone dies after receiving the vaccine, their doctor or family can file a VAERS report. (Edit: as of 11/5/21, the number in VAERS is up to 8,456 deaths in the US. You might also see a larger number quoted because VAERS now includes foreign vaccine deaths. The total number of reports from around the world is currently 18,461. I’ve restricted this analysis to the United States and I’m using the 6,000 deaths listed in June) We don’t know if the vaccine caused all these VAERS deaths or if some were coincidences. We’ve vaccinated 160 million people. On average, we should expect 4,000 of those people to die the day after they get vaccinated, for unrelated reasons. In the following week, we should expect 28,000 deaths. I tried looking into the VAERS reports. The average age of death is 74.  Most of the deaths occurred January through March, when elderly people were being vaccinated. We vaccinated even more people in March, April, and May, but VAERS deaths dropped off as we started vaccinating younger people:  For all of 2020, I listened to skeptical people ask 3 things about covid: “Is covid any worse than the flu?” “Did people really die from covid? or did they die with covid?” “Did they have other medical conditions?” These are good, skeptical questions. We should ask the same questions about vaccine deaths. We know that covid is worse than the flu. Covid has killed over 600,000 Americans. That’s 10 times worse than a bad flu year. For most age groups, your risk is 10–20 times higher of dying from covid:  The one exception is young children, where covid and the flu are both about the same. Most kids can fight off either infection. Let’s assume that all the VAERS deaths were caused by the vaccine. What does it look like if we put them in the same graph?  Chart is up to date with August 20th VAERS data. The vaccine might kill some people, but it’s about 20 times less deadly than the flu. It’s more than 100 times less deadly than getting covid. That’s assuming that all 6,000 people died from the vaccine. Did they? We know that most covid deaths were from covid, because 600,000 more people died than in a normal year. We don’t know if most people died from the vaccine, because there isn’t the same big spike in excess deaths. Let’s try just reading some of the case reports. The first case on the list is a 66 year old man at a senior living facility. He got the vaccine on 12/23 and died 2 days later. He was… not exactly healthy:  The next few cases are similar. Several are people in their 80’s with dementia. Many of the reports claim that there’s likely no connection to the vaccine, they’re just reporting the death to be on the safe side. Here’s an 89 year old woman who died 5 days after vaccination: Write-up: Resident in our long term care facility who received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine on 12/22/2020, only documented side effect was mild fatigue after receiving. She passed away on 12/27/2020 of natural causes per report. Has previously been in & out of hospice care, resided in nursing home for 9+ years, elderly with dementia. Due to proximity of vaccination we felt we should report the death, even though it is not believed to be related. This sounds like a lot of old people that “died with the vaccine”, not “died from the vaccine”. I don’t have time to read all 6,000 cases. I’ve read one study that looked at the first 250 reported deaths. 95% of these patients had comorbidities. More specifically, 14% were bedridden with a serious illness, which was the most likely cause of death. 81% had comorbid conditions, so it’s not clear if the vaccine caused the death. For 5% of the cases, the vaccine was the most likely cause of death. From that analysis, the true number of vaccine deaths could be only 300. We can compare the VAERS deaths to the average rates of death from all other causes:  Looks pretty similar. The deaths could mostly be random and unrelated. Let’s look at the cases for children, to see if those stand out as unusual. VAERS lists 7 deaths between 12 and 17 years old. 2 of those 7 died from suicide. Does the vaccine make kids kill themselves? Or is this just grieving parents that want an explanation for why it happened? 2 of the others seem seriously unhealthy. One 15 year old girl got the Moderna vaccine and died 4 days later. Her preexisting conditions include: “Trisomey 21, Atrioventricular canal s/p repair, hypothyroidism, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, cervical spine instability, hypotonia, scoliosis, feeding difficulties, renal dysplasia, autism, chronic constipation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing loss, binocular vision disorder, gastroesophgeal reflux” And then there are 3 young people that died from heart failure that seemed otherwise healthy. 1 is speculated to have had blood clots related to birth control pills. The VAERS database lists 3 deaths among infants. Infants are not getting the vaccine, so this should be suspicious. 2 of these look like data entry errors where the age was entered wrong — one is a suicide by gunshot. The only report that looks real is an infant death reported by a breastfeeding mother: Write-up: Patient received second dose of Pfizer vaccine on March 17, 2020 while at work. March 18, 2020 her 5 month old breastfed infant developed a rash and within 24 hours was inconsolable, refusing to eat, and developed a fever. Patient brought baby to local ER where assessments were performed, blood analysis revealed elevated liver enzymes. Infant was hospitalized but continued to decline and passed away. Diagnosis of TTP. No known allergies. No new exposures aside from the mother’s vaccination the previous day. Does the vaccine get into breastmilk? The first two studies said no. A third, more sensitive study said yes, in tiny amounts (2 parts per billion), which probably shouldn’t be a big deal. The antibodies that a mother makes do get into the breast milk. The usual effect of this should be positive, it should help protect a baby from covid. I don’t know if those antibodies could instead cause the symptoms listed above, in some rare case. So the vaccine might have killed one baby and 3 teenagers. I’m not sure. It’s hard to prove one way or another. Is there anything else we can say, statistically? One thought is that we’re using 3 different vaccines and each one should have a different risk profile. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use the same technology (messenger RNA). Pfizer and Moderna use different doses, the Moderna dose is 3 times as large. Moderna had twice the rate of minor side effects, like headache or fatigue, as Pfizer did, during trials. If mRNA is harmful, you might expect to see more deaths from the larger dose in Moderna. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine uses a different technology, you’d expect it could have a different death rate. We’ve given out more Pfizer vaccine than any other:  Vaccine counts from the CDC tracker, on 6/24 If all of these deaths are random, then the death rate for each vaccine should be proportional to the number of times it was used. Pfizer accounts for 53% of people vaccinated and 55% of the deaths. Moderna is 40% of the vaccines and 38% of the deaths. Johnson and Johnson is 7.9% of the vaccines and 6.9% of the deaths. So, Pfizer and Moderna have about the same death rates. There’s no dose dependence, no signal that higher dose Moderna is more dangerous. There’s a small question here because Johnson and Johnson uses only one shot and the other vaccines used two shots. Should we count by shots or by people vaccinated? I counted people, not shots. This kind of analysis is useful when it comes to looking at side effects. There are some rare side effects, and those show up more often with one vaccine than with another. But it seems unlikely that 3 different “deadly vaccines” would all be equally deadly. It seems more likely that the deaths are random events that aren’t related to vaccination. I can’t give exact explanations for each of the 6,000 deaths. The people were generally old with comorbidities. It’s likely that most of the deaths were not caused by the vaccine. Even if all 6,000 were vaccine deaths, getting the vaccine is 10 times safer than getting the flu and 100 times safer than getting covid. It would take a careful scientific study to get a better answer than that. The only thing I can say for sure is you’re not going to find that careful study on Youtube. Edit (12/21/21): if the vaccine is deadly to elderly people, you would expect another large wave of VAERS deaths when we started giving them booster shots. That did not happen:  Graph from vaersanalysis.info. Red bars show VAERS deaths (numbers listed on left hand side), blue bars show vaccine doses (dose numbers listed on the right hand side) The majority of VAERS deaths were reported during the original roll-out of vaccines. There was not a second wave of VAERS deaths when the booster shots came out, but there are still a few death reports trickling in. This supports the theory that most of the VAERS deaths were coincidences and not caused by the vaccine. But there may still be some vaccine deaths hidden in that data. Vaccine side effects: The vaccine does have side effects, that’s certain. 19,000 people ended up in the hospital after taking a vaccine. Some of these could also be coincidental. But many of the cases are allergic reactions that are obviously caused by the shot. Here’s one 55 year old woman: Write-up: 5 minutes after the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine administration, the patient developed flushing, hives, felt warm and eventually short of breath. She started to wheeze and was wheeled into ER c/o “I can’t breathe while holding throat and thrashing with facial flushness noted. PT took 2 Benadryls and had several Epi shots. She was then discharged from the ER and later on that day, started to feel short of breath again. In the ED today she was audibly gasping for air, however had no wheezing, had a normal saturation and a normal blood pressure. She had taken another dose of her EpiPen IM and diphenhydramine 50 mg by mouth prior to coming. She was then admitted to the hospital for further observation. While on the floor, she started to feel short of breath again (about 9 am on 12/18/2020), which required an RRT . Patient received another dose of diphenhydramine IV, methylprednisolone 125 mg IV and several doses of IM epinephrine. She also required oxygen. She was then transferred to an ICU for further care. People can get allergic reactions to any vaccine or drug. That’s why they make you sit and wait for 15 minutes after getting the shot, so you can get prompt treatment if you have a bad reaction. Other than that, we know that some people get blood clots after taking the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. The CDC says the odds are about 1 in 100,000, and it’s about 10% fatal if it happens. Australia is claiming the same rates. So, 1 in a million chance of death. The risk is lower than from many prescription drugs. And it’s much lower than the risk of getting blood clots from covid. We also know that some people get myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Young men under 30 are at the highest risk. The exact odds vary based on your age and gender:   We know this is from the vaccine because it happens more often than by chance (for every highlighted cell in these tables, the risk is higher than the annual risk you’ll get myocarditis for some other reason). We can also see that most of these reactions happened after the 2nd vaccine dose. If it were random, it would happen equally after both first and second doses. We can also see some dose dependence here — the higher dose moderna vaccine has roughly twice the risk as the lower dose pfizer vaccine. This should give us more confidence that the VAERS deaths are mostly not caused by the vaccines, since there is no dose dependence there. VAERS deaths are reported equally for Pfizer and Moderna. Either vaccine is still safer than covid, which can also cause myocarditis. For most people, covid is much worse than the vaccine. For teenage boys, the myocarditis vs. covid risk is closer, but getting covid is still worse by a factor of 6. I’m not sure the best way to balance these risks. For all age groups, getting the vaccine looks safer than getting the virus. But for young men and teens, it might make sense to get only 1 covid shot and skip the second dose. It also makes sense for young men to choose the Pfizer shot over Moderna. Should you take the shot? When we talk about safety, we can’t just look at the risk of the vaccine. We need to compare it to the virus. The whole reason we’re taking the vaccine is to prevent that disease. Covid has killed 600,000 Americans after infecting only 30% of the population. Without a vaccine, we’d see two to three times as many deaths before we get herd immunity. Maybe we’d get more than that, since immunity doesn’t last. Vaccinating the whole country now should save at least 600,000 lives. Even if all 6,000 VAERS deaths are real, using the vaccine would be a hundred times safer than letting everyone get the virus. In reality, the vaccine is probably more than a thousand times better. Society is taking a calculated risk that this is the best option. We don’t have a lot of other choices. No one has the patience for lockdowns. Masks help a little but covid is still spreading. If anything, the bigger tragedy is that we waited as long as we did to use them. If we had tested or approved the vaccine one month faster, we would have seen all the same side effects, but we would have prevented 100,000 covid deaths. We could also save a lot of lives by testing drugs faster. As an individual, you also need to make a calculated risk. The known risk of vaccine death is 1 in a million. There’s a small chance of serious side effects. We don’t know if the vaccine has some unexpected long term effects, but most vaccines don’t. In my analysis, getting the vaccine is much safer than getting covid, for everyone aged 12 and up. I have not run an analysis for children younger than 12, as the data is still coming in. I would suggest getting the Pfizer vaccine instead of Moderna, because the dose is lower. The Moderna vaccine does work slightly better to prevent covid and it lasts a bit longer, so there are benefits to the higher dose. If you’re not afraid of side effects, it may give you better protection. Both will keep you from getting hospitalized from covid, both are fine if you don’t have a choice. I would personally choose to take the smaller dose with less side effects. Some countries have made the same conclusion, Sweden went as far as banning the Moderna vaccine for anyone under 30. For teenage boys and for young men, it might be safer to get a single shot of the vaccine rather than two. That would give some protection against covid without much risk of myocarditis. Some countries have made this choice, Taiwan halted second shots for teens as of November. The US health authorities still recommend two shots for everyone. If you’re pregnant or breast-feeding or worried about fertility, I would read this FAQ from Dr Viki Male, who’s rounded up all the studies we have on covid vaccines and fertility. If you’ve recently had covid, I don’t think you need the vaccine at all. You should have natural immunity. Neither vaccine immunity or natural immunity will last forever. For most other coronaviruses, immunity only lasts about a year. So you might want to get a booster shot 6–12 months after you get covid, if you don’t want to get covid again. If you are forced to get the vaccine because of mandates, I’d suggest you just get it instead of losing your job. Unless you hate your job anyways, in which case I’d suggest you quit. Life is too short to work a job you hate. It’s also too short to worry about 1 in a million risks. I encourage people to be skeptical of the government and do their own research. But, if your alternate sources start telling you that the vaccine has killed 150,000 people, you need to be equally skeptical of that.																
74	1	Vaccine experts weigh in on side effects, efficacy rates, and how the vaccines stack up against the variants.  Ninety percent of adults in America will be eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine by April 19, according to the White House. This means that millions of people will have the chance to line up for their shot in less than three weeks. But what remains to be seen is how many eligible people will take that chance.  A Pew Research Center survey in late February found that 69% of Americans either have already been vaccinated or plan to be vaccinated. That’s up from the 60% who said they’d get vaccinated last November. Still, 30% of respondents said they would probably or definitely not get a vaccine. The top reasons given for foregoing it were concerns about how well the vaccines work, their side effects, and distrust in the quick development process.  AAMCNews spoke with vaccine experts to answer common questions about the COVID-19 vaccines.  How do the vaccines work? The United States has authorized three vaccines for emergency use, and a fourth is likely to go before the Food and Drug Administration for approval in the coming weeks.  Pfizer and Moderna: The first two COVID-19 vaccines to be greenlit in the United States use messenger RNA (mRNA), which is a molecule that instructs human cells to make a piece of the spike protein that the coronavirus uses to attach to and infect human cells. The material from the vaccine quickly disintegrates and never enters the cell’s nucleus, so it can’t alter the recipient’s DNA. The presence of the harmless spike proteins triggers the immune system to create antibodies and activate T-cells that mount an immune response. With the immune system primed, it is ready to act quickly if it ever detects the coronavirus in the body.  Researchers have been working on mRNA technology since the 1990s to fight a variety of diseases from influenza to Ebola, but the COVID-19 vaccine is the first time this technology has been authorized for the public.  The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses administered 21 days apart and the Moderna vaccine requires two doses 28 days apart.  Johnson & Johnson: The third vaccine to receive emergency use approval in the United States uses another relatively new vaccine technology that tweaks a harmless adenovirus — a type of virus that causes a common cold — to deliver the coronavirus spike protein instructions. After decades of research, the first adenovirus vaccine — used to protect against the Ebola virus — was approved in July 2020. Scientists reengineered the adenovirus in the COVID-19 vaccine so that it cannot replicate and make the recipient sick, but it can still deliver the spike protein instructions.  “It’s kind of like hijacking a known virus,” says Wilbur Chen, MD, an infectious disease and vaccine expert and chief of the adult clinical studies section of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health within the University of Maryland School of Medicine.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires only one dose.  (The CDC called for a pause using this vaccine on April 13 in order to further investigate its safety after a rare, but serious blood clotting condition that occurred in six women after vaccination.)  AstraZeneca: This vaccine is not yet approved in the United States, but its manufacturers plan to seek approval in the coming weeks. It works in a similar way to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, except it uses a reengineered adenovirus that typically infects chimpanzees. The AstraZeneca vaccine currently requires two doses given four weeks apart, but there is some uncertainty about how far apart the doses can be administered. The United Kingdom delayed the second shot to 12 weeks and one study suggests that the longer delay may have strengthened the vaccine’s effectiveness.  Which vaccine is the best one? The experts agreed: The best vaccine is the one that is first available to you.  “What I tell my patients and family members is to take whatever vaccine you can get,” says Mark Mulligan, MD, a professor at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and director of the NYU Langone Vaccine Center, who led the clinical trials for the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines at New York University (NYU). “They’re all highly effective. You can’t really make any discernment from one to another.”  Some have speculated that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines — with their roughly 95% efficacy rates in clinical trials — are better than the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (66% efficacy) and the AstraZeneca vaccine (76% efficacy). But comparing the different vaccines’ efficacy rates is sometimes like comparing apples and oranges, according to Anna Durbin, MD, a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore who specializes in infectious disease and vaccines.  “What I tell my patients and family members is to take whatever vaccine you can get. They’re all highly effective. You can’t really make any discernment from one to another.”  Mark Mulligan, MD Professor at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and director of the NYU Langone Vaccine Center  Efficacy data depends on many factors, including when and where the clinical trials took place, she says. Pfizer and Moderna, for example, tested their vaccines earlier in the pandemic and primarily in the United States before more contagious and deadly variants emerged, while much of Johnson & Johnson’s data was gathered in South America and South Africa, where particularly troubling variants were spreading.  Another complication is what the researchers conducting the clinical trials were measuring. The efficacy number reported in clinical trials was against any COVID-19 symptoms — even mild ones.  “What we’re trying to do is prevent severe illness,” Durbin explains. “All of them are close to 100% at preventing hospitalized COVID-19.”  In fact, experts say that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has some advantages over the mRNA vaccines, including that it does not require ultra-cold storage and can be given as a one-dose regimen.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that a person can consider themselves fully vaccinated two weeks after the single shot of Johnson & Johnson or the second shot of Pfizer or Moderna.  If a person has previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the timeline may be shortened. One study at NYU Grossman School of Medicine found that, in the days following the first vaccine dose, previously infected people produced similar or greater numbers of antibodies than previously uninfected people did after the second shot.  Mulligan, who led the study, says that the information could suggest that people who have had COVID-19 might only need one shot of the mRNA vaccines, but that requires further study.  Are the vaccines safe? Every vaccine that is approved in the United States, even if under emergency use authorization, undergoes stringent safety testing, and the CDC continues to collect data on any side effects or adverse outcomes that could be related to the vaccine over time.  People who receive vaccines may experience a number of side effects, such as a sore arm, fever, fatigue, chills, nausea, and body aches — especially after the second dose of one of the two-dose regimens. This is a sign that the immune system is reacting and is not a cause for concern. The CDC recommends taking a painkiller after (not before) getting the shot and exercising the arm to avoid soreness.  The side effects are generally more intense after the second shot, as the immune system reacts to the known spike protein. The CDC also reports that 80% of those who reported experiencing side effects were women, which may be related to sex hormones’ role in the immune response, according to a New York Times article.   There are some rare serious side effects, such as anaphylaxis — a life-threatening, but treatable, allergic reaction. In the United States, this reaction has occurred in about two to five people per million vaccinated and has not resulted in any deaths.  The CDC requires that vaccinated people stay at the vaccination site for observation for at least 15 minutes after getting the shot in case they do have a negative reaction.  Kathryn Edwards, MD, a vaccinologist and the Sarah H. Sell and Cornelius Vanderbilt professor of pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, spends most of her day assessing reactions after COVID-19 vaccines as part of her CDC-funded Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment unit. Her team, which is working with allergists, believes that someone who has an immediate anaphylactic reaction to the first dose of an mRNA vaccine should not receive the second dose of that vaccine but rather may be able to get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for their second shot with careful monitoring.  “I’ve been doing this a long time, and I don’t know that I’ve worked any harder than I am now. We want to make sure that the public knows that we want these vaccines to be both safe and effective.”  Kathryn Edwards, MD Vaccinologist and professor of pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine  Edwards also cautions that not all adverse reactions that happen around the time of vaccination are caused by the vaccine. As people with underlying conditions — particularly older individuals — receive a vaccine, heart attacks or strokes will happen and could be coincidental. Her team is working to determine whether certain reactions are happening more often than would be expected after vaccination.  For example, there is a concern that came up with the AstraZeneca vaccine that resulted in several countries pausing or limiting its use due to reports of blood clots. Edwards says that the number of people who have experienced blood clots after being vaccinated in the United States so far is lower than what would be expected in the everyday population. Still, the CDC is continually looking at these rates to identify any signal for a reaction that might be associated with a vaccine.  Though any long-term effects of the vaccines are not yet known, Edwards says that she and the CDC are being vigilant in investigating any potential problems as they arise.  “I’ve been doing this a long time,” she notes. “And I don’t know that I’ve worked any harder than I am now. We want to make sure that the public knows that we want these vaccines to be both safe and effective.”  Do the vaccines protect against the variants? The optimism that came with the approval of COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020 was tempered by the emergence of several coronavirus variants that had mutated to be more contagious, deadlier, and potentially able to evade the vaccines.  But the data so far suggest that currently available vaccines work well against the variants.  Chen says that those who are vaccinated and later infected with one of the concerning variants are still unlikely to be hospitalized. Though there is little real-world data on how the vaccines work against the B.1.351 variant — a particularly concerning one first detected in South Africa — one small clinical trial for the AstraZeneca vaccine was halted after it showed only 22% efficacy against the variant. Notably, none of the vaccinated people, who were generally low-risk for severe COVID-19 to begin with, were hospitalized or died.  The World Health Organization says that the vaccines are likely to provide at least some protection against each of the variants because they prompt a broad immune response beyond just targeting the spike protein that is the focus of the vaccines.  Pfizer and Moderna have begun testing third “booster” shots of the vaccines to see if the extra dose could provide further protection against the variants. They are also developing variant-specific vaccines targeting the B.1.351 variant.  Edwards would not be surprised if it turns out that people need to continue to get COVID-19 booster shots as additional variants emerge.  “When new strains emerge, we may need to make new vaccines. We have been doing that for many years [for the flu vaccine],” she explains. “We may need to do it for COVID as well.”  But it is still a race between vaccination and variants. The key to ending the pandemic is getting vaccines administered to people across the globe. As of March 30, there had been only 7.4 vaccine doses administered per 100 people globally, and many low-income countries had not yet administered a single dose, according to the New York Times vaccination tracker.  “Until the entire world has conquered the virus,” Durbin says, “we’re going to have to keep protecting ourselves.”																
75	1	Data must show that a COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can give emergency use authorization or approval. The safety of COVID-19 vaccines is closely monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and FDA.  The FDA has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, now called Comirnaty, to prevent COVID-19 in people age 16 and older. The FDA approved Comirnaty after data found the vaccine is safe and effective. The FDA has also approved the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, now called Spikevax, to prevent COVID-19 in people age 18 and older.  Vaccines with emergency use authorization by the FDA include:  Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 15 Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine The CDC recommends getting an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine over getting the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. But getting any COVID-19 vaccine is better than not getting a COVID-19 vaccine.																
76	1	"The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine appears to be safe in people previously diagnosed with myocarditis, according to a small study presented Thursday at a European medical conference.  The findings, experts say, should help reassure people who previously experienced myocarditis that Covid vaccination is safe.  Myocarditis is an inflammatory heart condition with a number of causes, including viral and bacterial infections. The mRNA Covid vaccines, from both Pfizer and Moderna, have also been linked to a small but increased risk of the condition.  The new study was presented virtually at the European Society of Cardiology Acute CardioVascular Care conference. It has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, though it is undergoing peer review.  Researchers from France studied 55 patients, most of them young men, who had been hospitalized with myocarditis within the last five years and were later inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine.  Patients were contacted by the researchers by phone and asked if they had been vaccinated, with which vaccine, how many times and whether they experienced any side effects.  They found that none of the patients experienced myocarditis, or any other serious adverse event after vaccination, suggesting that the Pfizer vaccine is not associated with a risk of recurrence of the condition. Because the vast majority of the patients in the study were vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, the findings cannot be applied to other currently available Covid shots, such as Moderna’s, the authors noted.  Get the Morning Rundown  Get a head start on the morning's top stories.  The results may be reassuring to those with a history of myocarditis who are reluctant to get vaccinated.  ""One of causes pushing us to conduct this study was a patient with a history of prior myocarditis refusing to be vaccinated against Covid, fearing a recurrence,"" lead study author Dr. Abou Saleh, a researcher at Hospices Civils de Lyon, a hospital in France, told NBC News in an email.  The findings, he said, may ""incite patients with prior history of myocarditis to get vaccinated.""  Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak  The study comes less than two weeks after Florida's surgeon general formally recommended against Covid vaccinations for healthy children, citing in part the rare risk of myocarditis in young men and teenage boys. The state softened its stance a day later, however.  Both Pfizer’s and Moderna’s Covid vaccines have been linked to a slightly elevated risk of myocarditis, particularly in men ages 18 to 29 following their second dose."																
77	1	Pfizer-BioNTech (COMIRNATY) Name Change Pfizer-BioNTech (COMIRNATY) received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval on August 23, 2021, for individuals ages 16 years and older. Once vaccines are approved by the FDA, companies can market the vaccines under brand names. COMIRNATY is the brand name for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. After FDA approval, the FDA-authorized Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for individuals ages 16 years and older was marketed as COMIRNATY. No change was made to the vaccine’s formula with the name change.  The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine label remains for individuals ages 5–15 years since the vaccine is authorized but not yet approved for this age group.  Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Ingredients All COVID-19 vaccine ingredients are safe. Nearly all of the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are ingredients found in many foods – fats, sugars, and salts. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine also contains a harmless piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). The COVID-19 mRNA teaches cells in the body how to create an immune response to the virus that causes COVID-19. This response helps protect you from getting sick with COVID-19 in the future. After the body produces an immune response, it discards all of the vaccine ingredients, just as it would discard any substance that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning.  All COVID-19 vaccines are manufactured with as few ingredients as possible and with very small amounts of each ingredient. Each ingredient in the vaccine serves a specific purpose as seen in the table below.  Pfizer-BioNTech has updated the formulation of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The updated formulation has the same active ingredients as the previous formulation but uses different stabilizers (ingredients that help keep the vaccine molecules stable while the vaccine is manufactured, frozen, shipped, and stored). These changes allow for easier shipping and longer storage of vaccines at refrigerator temperatures. This will help improve access to vaccines for people who need them and will decrease waste.  The previous formulation for people ages 12 years and older is no longer being distributed, and once the doses of that formulation have been used, only the updated formulation will be available. Both formulations can be used interchangeably without any safety or effectiveness concerns. Check with your healthcare provider about which formulation they carry if you are concerned about any of the ingredients.  Other authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines in the United States Moderna (ages 18 years and older) Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen (ages 18 years and older) You should get a COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible. All currently approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. However, CDC recommends that people who are starting their vaccine series or getting a booster dose get either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna (mRNA COVID-19 vaccines). The mRNA vaccines are preferred over Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine in most circumstances.  CDC does not recommend mixing products for a two-dose primary series or an additional primary dose. For a booster dose, adults ages 18 years and older may choose which vaccine product they get. CDC recommends either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna (mRNA COVID-19 vaccines) in most circumstances. Although mRNA vaccines are preferred, the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine may be considered in some situations.  Safety Data Summary Side effects that happen within 7 days of getting vaccinated are common but are mostly mild. Some people have side effects that affect their ability to do daily activities. Side effects (such as fever, chills, tiredness, and headache) throughout the body are more common after the second dose of the vaccine. Rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in adolescents and young adults have been reported more often after getting the second dose than after the first dose of one of the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna). These reports are rare and the known and potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks, including the possible risk of myocarditis or pericarditis. All FDA-approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines have undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. This monitoring includes using both established and new safety monitoring systemspdf icon to make sure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe.  How Well the Vaccine Works Based on evidence from clinical trials in people ages 16 years and older, the Pfizer-BioNTech (COMIRNATY) vaccine was 95% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed infection with the virus that causes COVID-19 in people who received two doses and had no evidence of being previously infected. In clinical trials, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had >90% efficacy in preventing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in children ages 5–15 years, and the immune response in children ages 5–15 years was at least as strong as the immune response in people ages 16–25 years. In clinical trials, the vaccine also had >90% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 among people of diverse age, sex, race, and ethnicity categories and among people with underlying medical conditions. Evidence shows some variation in levels of protection by vaccine. All FDA-approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines provide substantial protection against COVID-19 hospitalization. CDC will continue to provide updates as we learn more.																
78	1	Countries around the world are rolling out COVID-19 vaccines, and a key topic of interest is their safety. Vaccine safety is one of WHO’s highest priorities, and we’re working closely with national authorities to develop and implement standards to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.  Ensuring safety Billions of people have been safely vaccinated against COVID-19. All of the approved COVID-19 vaccines have been carefully tested and continue to be monitored.  Like all vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines go through a rigorous, multi-stage testing process, including large clinical trials that involve tens of thousands of people. These trials are specifically designed to identify any safety concerns.  An external panel of experts convened by WHO analyses the results from clinical trials and recommends whether and how the vaccines should be used. Officials in individual countries decide whether to approve the vaccines for national use and develop policies for how to use the vaccines based on WHO recommendations.    After a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced, WHO supports work with vaccine manufacturers, health officials in each country and other partners to monitor for any safety concerns on an ongoing basis.  New vaccine technology Some COVID-19 vaccines have been developed with an approach that uses messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA vaccine technology has been studied for over a decade, including in the development of vaccines for Zika, rabies and influenza.  These mRNA vaccines have been rigorously assessed for safety, and clinical trials have shown that they provide a long-lasting immune response. mRNA vaccines are not live virus vaccines and do not interfere with human DNA. For more information on mRNA vaccines, see WHO’s explainer on the different types of COVID-19 vaccines.  Safety of COVID-19 vaccines for different groups COVID-19 vaccines have been tested in large, randomized controlled trials that include people of a broad age range, all sexes, different ethnicities, and those with known medical conditions. The vaccines have shown a high level of efficacy across all populations. Vaccines have been found to be safe and effective in people with various underlying medical conditions that are associated with increased risk of severe disease. These include high blood pressure; diabetes; asthma; pulmonary, liver or kidney disease; and chronic infections that are stable and controlled.  Those who should consult with a doctor before vaccination include people with a compromised immune system, older people with severe frailty, people with a history of severe allergic reaction to vaccines, people living with HIV, and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. For more information about vaccine safety for different groups, please see our Q&A on COVID-19 vaccine safety.  Pregnancy You can get vaccinated whilst you are pregnant. During pregnancy, you are at higher risk of serious illness caused by COVID-19. You are also at higher risk of delivering your baby prematurely if you contract COVID-19. While there is less data available on vaccination of pregnant people, evidence on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy has been growing, and no safety concerns have been identified. Especially in countries with high transmission, or if you have an occupation where you are at more risk of being exposed to COVID-19, the benefits of getting the vaccine outweigh potential risks. There is no risk of getting COVID-19 from the vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider to make an informed decision about vaccination.  Questions and Answers: COVID-19 vaccines and pregnancy  Breastfeeding  If you are breastfeeding, you should get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as it is your turn. None of the current COVID-19 vaccines have live virus in them. This means there is no risk of you transmitting COVID-19 to your baby through your breastmilk from the vaccine.  In fact, the antibodies you get after vaccination may go through your breast milk and help to protect your baby.   Safety of COVID-19 vaccines for children The Pfizer vaccine is safe for use in children aged 5 years and above. For children in this age group, WHO recommends a reduced dosage of 10 µg (0.2 ml). Both Pfizer and Moderna are safe for use in children aged 12 and above using a dose of 0.3 ml and 0.5 ml respectively.  However, while the availability of COVID-19 vaccines is limited, WHO recommends that countries should vaccinate children only when high vaccine coverage with two doses has been achieved in higher priority-use groups, as identified in the WHO Prioritization Roadmap. However, children with existing health conditions should be prioritised for vaccination at the same time as other high risk groups.  Vaccine trials to determine whether other COVID-19 vaccines are safe for use in children are ongoing, and WHO recommendations will be updated when the evidence supports a change in the policy.   Practicing the protective behaviours is still the best way to keep everyone, including children, safe from COVID-19, whether or not you have been vaccinated. Keep a safe distance from others, avoid crowds, wear a well-fitting mask covering your mouth and nose, keep indoor spaces well ventilated, clean hands regularly and cover coughs and sneezes, as well as getting vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn.																
79	1	Overall effectiveness has been reported in the range of 70% to 95%. That’s well above the average effectiveness of the flu vaccine, for example.  A Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine trial involving nearly 44,000 volunteers found vaccination to be 95% effective. This vaccine is authorized for use in the US. A Moderna vaccine trial enrolling more than 30,000 volunteers reported an effectiveness of 94%. This vaccine is authorized for use in the US. An AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine trial reported average effectiveness of 70% with full doses, but even better results (as high as 90%) with a lower dose. This vaccine is authorized for use in Great Britain, but not in the US. A Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) trial reported overall effectiveness of 66% (72% in the US) in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19. This vaccine is authorized for use in the US. Not only do these vaccines appear to lessen risk of developing COVID-19, but they also appear to lessen the risk of severe disease. (Click here for additional information on available vaccines.)  What are the most common COVID vaccine side effects? In large clinical trials, most side effects have been minor. When side effects occur, they typically last just a few days. A side effect or reaction isn’t necessarily all bad, by the way; it may indicate that the body is building protection against the virus.  For the four vaccines listed above, common side effects include  pain at the site of the injection painful, swollen lymph nodes in the arm where the vaccine was injected tiredness headache muscle or joint aches nausea and vomiting fever or chills. What else should I know about possible side effects? Severe allergic reactions. Rarely, a potentially life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis may occur, most often in people known to have had severe vaccine reactions in the past. CDC estimates suggest anaphylaxis occurs in 11 cases per million doses among people receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The signs are trouble breathing, swelling of the face and throat, rash, and low blood pressure. It usually occurs soon after vaccination, and can be treated with epinephrine (as in an EpiPen). That’s why people are observed for at least 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine with epinephrine at the ready. Unexplained deaths. A recent report of 23 deaths among elderly vaccine recipients in Norway raised understandable safety concerns about the new COVID-19 vaccines. However, further investigation is needed to determine whether these deaths were related to the vaccines, or represent an expected number of deaths among frail individuals who already may have had a limited life expectancy. Pushing back on two vaccine misconceptions It’s normal to feel cautious about any new treatment. But two common misconceptions may encourage people to avoid getting a COVID vaccine.  Health problems incorrectly blamed on the vaccine. When health problems develop soon after vaccination, people tend to blame the vaccine. Yet cancer, strokes, heart attacks, blood disorders, and rare illnesses occurred before the pandemic, and will of course continue to happen. Many people would be expected to develop such health issues whether or not they get vaccinated. If thorough investigation shows certain health problems are occurring at a higher than normal rate, the vaccine could be to blame. If not, it’s more likely to be an unfortunate coincidence that’s not related to the vaccine.For example, rare cases of Bell’s palsy and other neurologic disease have been reported after COVID vaccination. But so far, there is no clear suggestion that the vaccine played any role. Similarly, a fatal blood disorder suffered by a Florida physician two weeks after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine raised concerns that it was triggered by the vaccine. Authorities are investigating this and similar cases. This condition did not occur among the tens of thousands of clinical trial subjects, so it might be a complete coincidence. Concerns that the vaccine can cause COVID-19. That can’t happen, because no live SARS-CoV-2 virus is used in currently available vaccines or those in development. If a person develops COVID-19 soon after vaccination, it’s not due to the vaccine. It’s either because the vaccine failed (which is rather rare), or infection developed before the vaccine had a chance to work. In fact, some people may already be infected with the virus at the time of vaccination. The bottom line So far, we know COVID-19 is an unpredictable and potentially deadly disease. And the information we have about the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccinations is encouraging. Minor side effects should be expected; severe allergic reactions may rarely occur. Side effects from the vaccine are not reasons for most people to avoid vaccination.  As the number of vaccine recipients and the number of different vaccines grow, vigilance is warranted. What we know today about side effects and safety won’t be the last word. Volunteers in clinical trials and members of the public who have received vaccinations continue to be monitored, and are encouraged to report problems.  There are pros and cons to any new medical treatment. But remember there are also pros and cons to declining treatment. Based on my reading of currently available information, the decision to be vaccinated against COVID-19 should be an easy one.																
80	1	A small study has shown that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients who had an inflamed heart muscle in the past is not associated with a recurrence of the condition or other serious side effects. The research is presented at ESC Acute CardioVascular Care 2022, a scientific congress of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).[1]  “These results provide reassuring data that may encourage patients with a history of myocarditis to get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2,” said study author Dr. Iyad Abou Saleh of Hospices Civils de Lyon, France. “It should be noted that the majority of patients in our study received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and therefore the findings may not apply to other vaccines.”[2]  Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle. Signs and symptoms include fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, and rapid heartbeats. The inflammation can reduce the heart’s ability to pump and can also cause arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). Prevalence is estimated at 10 to 106 cases per 100,000 individuals worldwide.[3] The leading cause of myocarditis is viral infection.  Rare cases of myocarditis following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been reported in the scientific literature with a prevalence of 2.1 cases for 100,000 inhabitants.[4-6] However, there are a lack of data regarding the risk of myocarditis recurrence after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with a history of the condition.  Dr. Abou Saleh pointed out: “Our experience shows that in some situations patients have avoided vaccination because they, or their GP, were afraid it could cause another bout of myocarditis. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination would not increase the risk of myocarditis recurrence in patients who had the condition in the past.”  The researchers included all patients hospitalized in Hospices Civils de Lyon during the last five years (from January 2016 to June 2021) with a diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Patients were contacted by telephone and asked if they had been vaccinated, with which vaccine, how many times, and whether they had any side effects. Patients were also asked if they currently had COVID-19 or had contracted it in the past.  A total of 142 patients with a prior history of confirmed acute myocarditis were enrolled in the study. The average age was 31 years and 20.3% were women. Among them, vaccination status was known for 71 patients (50%): 55 patients were vaccinated and 16 were not vaccinated. The main reason given for not getting the vaccine was the fear of myocarditis recurrence (12 patients, 75% of non-vaccinated patients). Vaccination status was unknown for 66 patients and five patients had died before the COVID-19 outbreak.  Among the vaccinated patients, 12 had one dose and 43 had two doses. Patients were mainly vaccinated with BNT162b2 mRNA (53 patients, 96.4%). One patient had the mRNA-1273 vaccine[7] and one had the Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant] vaccine.[8]  The researchers also obtained information about side effects following vaccination from medical records. These included serious events such as death, arrhythmias, and recurrent myocarditis. There were no serious adverse events after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.  Dr. Abou Saleh said: “We showed that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with a history of acute myocarditis is not associated with a risk of recurrent myocarditis or other serious side effects. Our results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients and the predominant use of one type of vaccine.”																
81	1	Overview What is COVID-19? COVID-19 is a new illness that affects the lungs and breathing. It is caused by a new coronavirus. Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and trouble breathing. COVID-19 may also cause stomach problems, such as nausea and diarrhea, and a loss of your sense of smell or taste. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after you are exposed to the virus. Some people with COVID-19 may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms.  Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine? Yes, you are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated. Vaccines are recommended for people age 5 and older. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends vaccination if you are pregnant, postpartum, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy. Find out how to get a COVID-19 vaccine near you through the CDC website.  For information about vaccines for children 11 and under, visit the American Academy of Pediatrics website healthychildren.org.  Are COVID-19 vaccines safe and effective? Yes, studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and highly effective. The COVID-19 vaccines can prevent infection, severe illness, and death from COVID-19, including from new variants.  Before vaccines are given to the public, vaccines go through many layers of testing and reviews. The COVID-19 vaccines meet strict safety standards required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Millions of people in the United States have safely received COVID-19 vaccines.  Getting a Vaccine What vaccines are available in the United States? There are three COVID-19 vaccines in the United States: Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two shots. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires only one shot. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been shown to be the most effective. Learn more from the CDC about the different vaccines.  Which vaccine should I get? Most adults age 18 and older should get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.  Adults can get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine if they have an allergy to ingredients in the other vaccines, have limited access to the other vaccines, or still prefer this vaccine after understanding the risks and benefits. Read “Is the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine safe?” below.  Children and teens between 5 and 17 can only get the Pfizer vaccine.  If you are pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding, you should follow these same recommendations.  Do I need a booster shot? Yes. Over time, protection from a vaccine can decline. A booster dose improves (boosts) your body’s ability to protect you from illness. Everyone 12 and older should get a booster. This includes anyone who is pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding.  Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are recommended for booster shots. You do not need to choose the same vaccine that you originally received.  The timing of the booster depends on which vaccine you originally received:  Johnson & Johnson—Get a Pfizer or Moderna booster at least 2 months after your first dose. You may get a Johnson & Johnson booster in some cases.  Pfizer and Moderna—Get a Pfizer or Moderna booster at least 5 months after your second dose. You may get a Johnson & Johnson booster in some cases.  You can get a booster at any time during pregnancy. If you were originally vaccinated before pregnancy and you are now pregnant, you should still get a booster.  What if I have a weakened immune system? People who have weakened immune systems may need an extra dose of the vaccine. This is an extra “primary” dose—part of the first series of shots you get before you need a booster later. You may also need to get a booster shot sooner than other people. Read the current CDC guidelines on vaccines for people with weakened immune systems.  Do COVID-19 vaccines have side effects? It’s common to feel side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine. There are different types of COVID-19 vaccines that have varying side effects. Side effects also vary from person to person. Some vaccines may make you feel like you have the flu for a few days. This is normal.  If you have a fever or other side effects after getting the vaccine, you can take over-the-counter (OTC) pain relief medication. If you are pregnant, the OTC medication acetaminophen is safe to take during pregnancy.  If you are worried about your side effects or they last more than a few days, talk with your health care professional.  Do I need a vaccine if I already had COVID-19? Yes, you still need a vaccine even if you have had COVID-19 in the past. There is no way to tell how protected you are from COVID-19 after infection. Your level of protection may vary based on how severe your illness was, how long it has been since you were sick, and how old you are.  A growing amount of data shows that the COVID-19 vaccine gives more protection against future illness than the protection you might have after getting the virus. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine will help prevent you from getting COVID-19 again and strengthen your protection against severe illness.  Pregnancy, Breastfeeding, and Fertility Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy? Yes, you should get a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. ACOG strongly recommends that all pregnant women be vaccinated against COVID-19. Getting a vaccine could help both you and your fetus. Remember that pregnant women have a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 than nonpregnant women. The vaccines are very effective at preventing infection, severe illness, and death from COVID-19.  When you get vaccinated, the antibodies made by your body may be passed to your fetus. These antibodies may help protect your baby from the virus after birth. How much protection your antibodies may provide is not yet known.  [Infographic: Why Should I Get the COVID-19 Vaccine While I'm Pregnant?]  Are COVID-19 vaccines safe during pregnancy? Yes, a growing amount of data confirms that COVID-19 vaccines are safe during pregnancy. Scientists have compared the pregnancies of women who have received COVID-19 vaccines and women who have not. The reports show that these women have had similar pregnancy outcomes. Data do not show any safety concerns.  If you are pregnant and want to know more about the vaccines, you can talk with your obstetrician–gynecologist (ob-gyn). This conversation is not required to get a vaccine, though it may be helpful.  Learn more from the CDC about COVID-19 vaccines, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.  Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine if I am breastfeeding? Yes, ACOG strongly recommends that breastfeeding women get a COVID-19 vaccine. Breastfeeding after vaccination is safe for the baby. There is no need to stop breastfeeding if you want to get a vaccine. When you get vaccinated, the antibodies made by your body may be passed through breast milk and may help protect your child from the virus.  Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine if I am trying to get pregnant? Yes, if you are planning or trying to get pregnant, you should get a COVID-19 vaccine. There is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility, and a growing amount of data confirms this. You also do not need to delay getting pregnant after you get a vaccine.  Learn more from the CDC about COVID-19 vaccines for people who would like to have a baby.  Other Questions Can COVID-19 vaccines affect menstrual periods? A recent study of nearly 4,000 people found there was a very small, temporary change in menstrual cycle length after vaccination. Periods were late by less than 1 day on average and returned to normal within 1 or 2 months.  Menstrual cycles often change a small amount from month to month. Temporary changes can be caused by many factors, including stress, lifestyle changes, and some underlying health conditions. Small changes in cycle length are normal and do not affect health or fertility.  More research is needed on this topic and in more diverse groups of people, but the results of this study are reassuring. This is good evidence that any effect of the COVID-19 vaccines on periods is temporary, small, and no cause for concern.  Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine while I’m on my period? Yes, you can get a COVID-19 vaccine while you have your menstrual period. There is no need to reschedule.  Can COVID-19 vaccines affect breast cancer screening (mammography)? There have been reports of COVID-19 vaccines causing swollen lymph nodes in underarms. This is a temporary side effect, but the swelling can make mammograms hard to read correctly. Because of this side effect, routine mammograms may be postponed for 4 to 6 weeks after you get a COVID-19 vaccine.  If you have any problems with your breasts or if you are at high risk for breast cancer, you should not delay your mammogram. If you do have a mammogram fewer than 4 to 6 weeks after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, tell the health care staff when you got your vaccine, which type of vaccine you had, and which arm the shot went in.  Remember, breast cancer screening is important health care that you should not skip. Read Mammography and Other Screening Tests for Breast Problems to learn more.  What should I know about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and myocarditis? There have been rare reports of temporary inflammation in or around the heart muscle after vaccination with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. These conditions are called myocarditis and pericarditis. These cases have been seen mostly in male teens and young adults. Most patients do well with treatment and quickly feel better.  The risk of illness and death from COVID-19 is far greater than the rare risks of myocarditis and pericarditis. The CDC continues to recommend everyone age 5 and older get a COVID-19 vaccine.  Is the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine safe? All vaccines have gone through intense safety studies and health officials continue to track their safety. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has potential risks, but they are very rare. The vaccine has been linked to two rare health conditions:  Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a condition involving blood clots and other symptoms. Most cases of these blood clots have been reported in women under age 50.  Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune system disorder that affects the nervous system.  These conditions have only been reported in a few people out of every million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine that have been given. But because of these rare risks, health officials recommend getting the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines instead of Johnson & Johnson. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine can still be given in some cases (read the question “Which vaccine should I get?” above).  If you choose to get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you should be aware of the potential risks.  What should I know about the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine and birth control? Some hormonal birth control methods are linked to a small increased risk of blood clots. The type of blood clot related to birth control is different than the type of blood clot syndrome related to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. There is no need to change birth control methods if you get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Hormonal birth control should not affect your risk of blood clots after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.  I have heard rumors about how the vaccines can affect my body. What is the truth? COVID-19 vaccines work in different ways, and all of them are proven to be safe. It is important to know that:  The vaccines cannot give you COVID-19. None of the vaccines uses the live virus that causes COVID-19.  The vaccines do not affect your genes or DNA.  There is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility. ACOG recommends vaccination for anyone who may consider getting pregnant in the future.																
82	1	Many parents have been anxiously awaiting the moment that Covid-19 vaccines become authorized for their children, hoping that the shots would provide confidence and security as the kids return to normal activities. Others have been more wary, concerned that rare side effects like myocarditis will outweigh the vaccine’s benefits considering that kids are less likely than adults to experience severe outcomes from the disease.  A variety of seemingly-conflicting headlines have added to the confusion about when the vaccines will be ready. Pfizer’s is the only vaccine authorized for children five and over, but Moderna’s was expected to be authorized for adolescents (age 12 to 17) in the fall of 2021 until the FDA said it needed more time to review potential adverse reactions. In the meantime, Moderna completed its trial on younger kids, ages 6 to 11, but rather than submitting that data to the FDA, the company said it would wait until the agency finished reviewing the previously-submitted adolescent data. Pfizer planned to end the clinical trials for patients under five near the end of 2021, but in February 2022, changed course and added a third shot in hopes of increasing efficacy in the midst of Omicron.  The whirlwind of news has left many parents scratching their heads and full of frustration. Smithsonian reached out to experts to understand what the future might hold.  Why are separate trials needed for children? In order to be authorized for use in kids, any drug or vaccine needs to undergo child-specific clinical trials, which usually occur after a drug has already been proven safe in adults. Kids are not just small adults and adjusting the doses based on their size isn’t enough to guarantee safety and efficacy. “Children’s immune systems are still building, so sometimes children will respond slowly or not at all to vaccines,” says Mobeen Rashore, an infectious disease pediatrician at the University of Florida. Sometimes they need additional doses to coax their immune systems to develop a sufficient response.  Other times, they may respond more robustly than adults, leading to additional side effects. “If you give kids a higher dose of vaccine, it’s possible that they have more side effects. More fevers, they can have more swelling of the arm, or they can have more pain, or other things that we don’t know about,” says Rashore. Still, “you don’t want to give a vaccine dose that is so small that it’s not effective.”  “For some pathogens kids simply don’t need as much [as adults],” says Buddy Creech, a pediatrician at Vanderbilt University and a principal investigator in Moderna’s pediatric vaccine trials. “With influenza, we historically have given a slightly smaller amount. For other vaccines, it really doesn’t matter as much.”  Moderna and Pfizer have been testing smaller doses of their Covid vaccine on children to see if they can provide protection without raising side effects.  What vaccines are available for kids and how well do they work? So far, Pfizer’s vaccine is that only one authorized for patients 5 to 17 years old. No Covid vaccines have been authorized for those under 5.  Scientists and regulators use two main strategies to evaluate effectiveness of Covid vaccines in younger populations. The first, of course, is comparing the number of Covid cases in a vaccinated group of patients to that in a group of patients who received a placebo. However, it can take a long time for there to be enough cases to reach statistical significance, so they also look at the immunogenicity—a measure of how strongly the immune system responded to the vaccine. By measuring the number of antibodies a child produces after vaccination and comparing that to the number of antibodies adults produced, the researchers can reasonably assume a similar level of protection.  In May of 2021, the FDA authorized Pfizer’s vaccine for adolescents aged 12 to 15. Out of about 1,000 patients who received the vaccine, no cases of Covid-19 occurred a week after vaccination. In the placebo group, 16 cases occurred. Those who received the vaccine also showed similar levels of antibodies to those of vaccinated young adults (16 to 25 years of age).  The Pfizer vaccine was authorized for children 5 to 11 years old on October 29, 2021. The clinical trials showed that a dose of 10 μg elicited similar immune responses to the 30 μg dose for those 12 to 15 years old and was about 90 percent effective at preventing Covid-19.  Moderna published results of its trials of two 100 μg shots in 12 to 17 year old patients in the New England Journal of Medicine in August of 2021 and applied for FDA authorization, but in October, the company announced that the FDA needed more time to review the possibility of an increased risk of myocarditis in this age group. In the same month, the company published a press release with data from its trial of two 50 µg shots in 6 to 11 year olds that said the children mounted an immune response comparable to that of adults, but the full results are not yet available and the company won’t submit it to the FDA until the review of the adolescent data is complete.  As the Omicron variant took hold, researchers have found that the vaccines were less effective against infection in individuals of all ages, however they still provided substantial protection against hospitalization and death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a report on March 11, in which over 1,200 children aged 5 to 15, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, were tested for Covid-19 weekly between July 2021 and February 2022, regardless of whether or not they showed symptoms. As Omicron surged, the Pfizer vaccine reduced the risk of infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic) among 12 to 15 year olds by 59 percent and 5 to 12 year olds by 31 percent.  Why hasn’t a vaccine been approved for kids under 5 years old? During the rise of Omicron, the companies were also running trials for the youngest patients: kids under the age of five. While Pfizer had originally announced that it expected the shot to be available by the end of 2021, it instead published a press release in February saying that it would be adding a third shot to the regimen to see if it could coax a more robust antibody response. The company expects new results in early April.  Adding a third shot is the most practical option for Pfizer. First, the company won’t have to start an entirely new trial with new participants at a different dose. Second, the company can reduce the risk of increasing side effects by not increasing the dose. Pfizer is using a 3 μg dose in each shot because in early-phase trials, a larger 10 μg dose caused high fevers in many of the children, an outcome that was minimized with the smaller dose.  Moderna, on the other hand is testing two larger doses, 25 μg, four weeks apart. Data is expected this month.  Are there any vaccine safety issues or side effects unique to children? Kids tend to fare better than adults if they get sick with Covid-19, but there is one long-term outcome unique to these younger patients: multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a dangerous condition that can cause a variety of symptoms from dizziness and vomiting to bloodshot eyes and often leads to hospitalization after a child recovers from Covid.  “We've been monitoring for that very closely,” says Creech. “And thankfully, we have not seen that side effect occur outside of some extraordinary situations which seem to be linked more to a recent infection than to the vaccine.”  The other concern is myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle characterized by shortness of breath, chest pain and the feeling that the heart is beating rapidly. So far about 70 out of every million boys age 12 to 15 and 105 out of every million boys age 16 to 17 experienced myocarditis a week after vaccination. “It is fairly rare that we have seen it,” says Marcos Mestre, a chief medical officer at Niklaus Children’s Hospital in Florida. “And we haven’t really seen many cases at all in the 5 to 11 year age range.”  In a study published in December of adolescents and young adults who experienced myocarditis after Covid vaccination, all patients recovered fully, and most were treated only with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS).  Why hasn’t uptake been high for those kids eligible to get the vaccine? Since Pfizer’s vaccine was authorized for teens and kids five and over, the number of kids getting vaccinated has fallen far below healthcare experts’ hopes and expectations. By March 16, only 60 percent of 12 to 17 year olds and 27 percent of 5 to 11 year olds had been fully vaccinated.  There are several reasons why parents may be hesitant to vaccinate their kids, which Rathore calls “a shame.”  The first is that the disease is less likely to be severe in children than it is in adults. “If you look at rates of immunization, they seem to track with how severe the illness often is in that population. We've done a fantastic job of vaccinating the over 65 population, because the mortality was rightly seen as quite high and as individuals, the younger you get, maybe there's less of a recognition that there can be significant consequences to the disease,” says Creech.  “It's true that children don't often get as sick as adults do. But they do get sick,” says Rathore.  And “they can get the dreaded MIS-C still.”  Another factor is that by the time the vaccines for younger patients were approved, many children may have been infected and recovered. “With some rationale, which I don't disagree with, they said, ‘Well, I'm protected for a certain period of time,’” says Mestre, so they might delay vaccination.  Lastly, mixed messaging has left some parents concerned and confused. On March 8, the Florida surgeon general announced that the state would not be recommending the vaccines for healthy children. In response to the announcement, Rathore, who practices in Florida, says “Most pediatricians and other physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, CDC, WHO and almost all other credible organizations recommend that children five years and older be vaccinated with Covid vaccine to protect them. I am in agreement with this position that all eligible children should be vaccinated with Covid vaccine to protect our children.”  What should parents with children under 5 do now? Rathore wants to assure parents that the delay has nothing to do with safety. “There’s no question about safety,” he says. “No parents should have that concern. The only thing we’re trying to make sure is that children are given an effective dose on an effective schedule.”  In the meantime, Mestre says that, “I understand as a parent myself the anxiety that’s caused by having the Covid infection,” says Mestre. “I would tell them to make sure everybody else in the household that’s eligible to be vaccinated receive the vaccine. . . to decrease the risk to that younger child,” while continuing to use other mitigation measures like masking and distancing.																
83	1	Submission based on real-world safety and efficacy data from Israel  •    Data showed rates of confirmed infections were 2 times lower and rates of severe illness were 4 times lower among individuals who received an additional booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine compared to individuals who received only an initial booster  NEW YORK and MAINZ, GERMANY, MARCH 15, 2022 — Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced the companies have submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of an additional booster dose for adults 65 years of age and older who have received an initial booster of any of the authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines. The submission is based on two real-world data sets from Israel analyzed at a time when the Omicron variant was widely circulating. These data showed evidence that an additional mRNA booster increases immunogenicity and lowers rates of confirmed infections and severe illness.   An analysis of Israeli Ministry of Health records was conducted for over 1.1 million adults 60 years of age and older who had no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and were eligible for an additional (fourth dose) booster. These data showed rates of confirmed infections were 2 times lower and rates of severe illness were 4 times lower among individuals who received an additional booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine administered at least four months after an initial booster (third) dose compared to those who received only one booster dose.  Also included in the submission are results from an ongoing, open-label, non-randomized clinical trial in healthcare workers 18 years of age and older at a single study center in Israel who had been vaccinated with three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Among the 154 (out of 700) participants who received an additional booster (fourth) dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine at least four months following the initial booster, neutralizing antibody titers increased approximately 7-fold to 8-fold at two and three weeks after the additional booster (fourth) dose compared to five months after the initial booster (third) dose. Additionally, there was an 8-fold and 10-fold increase in neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) at one and two weeks after the additional booster dose, respectively, compared to five months after the initial booster. The study also revealed no new safety concerns in individuals who received an additional booster dose of the vaccine.  Emerging evidence, including data from Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), suggests that effectiveness against both symptomatic COVID-19 1,2,3,4,5  and severe disease1,5 caused by Omicron wanes 3 to 6 months after receipt of an initial booster (third) dose. Thus, additional booster doses may be needed to ensure individuals remain adequately protected. The data being reviewed by the FDA from Israel suggest that  an additional booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine administered at least 4 months after an initial booster dose could restore antibody titers to peak post-third dose titer levels, 7 improve protection against both infection and severe disease in individuals 60 years of age and older in Israel,7 and have a similar safety profile to that of previous doses.6  The data from KPSC were provided to the FDA as an example of waning of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, but have not been reviewed by the agency.   The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is currently authorized as a single booster dose administered at least five months after completion of a primary series of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) to individuals 12 years of age and older. A single booster dose can also be administered to individuals 18 years of age and older who have completed primary vaccination with another authorized or approved COVID-19 Vaccine. Clinical and real-world data continue to show that people who are vaccinated, particularly those who have received a booster, maintain a high level of protection, particularly against severe disease and hospitalization. The companies remain vigilant and continue to collect data to explore new vaccine approaches and regimens to reduce the risk of infection and the risk of severe COVID-19 disease.  The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, which is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology, was developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer. BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries. Submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are planned.  U.S. Indication & Authorized Use  HOW IS THE VACCINE GIVEN?  The vaccine will be given as an injection into the muscle.  Primary Series:  In individuals 5 years of age and older, the vaccine is administered as a 2-dose series, 3 weeks apart. In individuals 5 years of age and older, a third primary series dose may be administered at least 28 days after the second dose to individuals who are determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise.  Booster Dose:  •    A single booster dose of the vaccine may be administered at least 5 months after completion of a primary series of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) to individuals 12 years of age and older •    A single booster dose of the vaccine may be administered to individuals 18 years of age and older who have completed primary vaccination with another authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine.

84	1	The world is in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic. As WHO and partners work together on the response -- tracking the pandemic, advising on critical interventions, distributing vital medical supplies to those in need--- they are racing to develop and deploy safe and effective vaccines.   Vaccines save millions of lives each year. Vaccines work by training and preparing the body’s natural defences – the immune system – to recognize and fight off the viruses and bacteria they target. After vaccination, if the body is later exposed to those disease-causing germs, the body is immediately ready to destroy them, preventing illness.  There are several safe and effective vaccines that prevent people from getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19. This is one part of managing COVID-19, in addition to the main preventive measures of keeping a safe distance from others and avoiding crowds, wearing a well-fitting mask covering your mouth and nose, keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, cleaning hands regularly and covering coughs and sneezes.  As of 12 January 2022, WHO has evaluated that the following vaccines against COVID-19 have met the necessary criteria for safety and efficacy:  AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine Johnson and Johnson Moderna Pfizer/BionTech Sinopharm Sinovac COVAXIN Covovax Nuvaxovid    Read our Q&A on the Emergency Use Listing process to find out more about how WHO assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.  Some national regulators have also assessed other COVID-19 vaccine products for use in their countries.  Take whatever vaccine is made available to you first, even if you have already had COVID-19. It is important to be vaccinated as soon as possible once it’s your turn and not wait. Approved COVID-19 vaccines provide a high degree of protection against getting seriously ill and dying from the disease, although no vaccine is 100% protective.  WHO SHOULD GET VACCINATED  All COVID-19 vaccines with WHO EUL are safe for most people 18 years and older, including those with pre-existing conditions of any kind, including auto-immune disorders. These conditions include: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as chronic infections that are stable and controlled.  If supplies are limited in your area, discuss your situation with your care provider if you:  Have a compromised immune system Are pregnant (if you are already breastfeeding, you should continue after vaccination) Have a history of severe allergies, particularly to a vaccine (or any of the ingredients in the vaccine) Are severely frail   WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has concluded that the Pfizer vaccine is safe to be used for those aged 5 and above, and the Moderna vaccine can be used for those aged 12 and above. A smaller dosage is required for children than for adults. Children and adolescent who are at high-risk of severe COVID-19 may be offered these vaccines alongside other priority groups for vaccination.  Children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults, so unless they are part of a group at higher risk of severe COVID-19, the priority should be to fully vaccinate older people, those with chronic health conditions and health workers.     Vaccine trials for children are ongoing and WHO will update its recommendations when the evidence or epidemiological situation warrants a change in policy.     Also see: Interim statement on COVID-19 vaccination for children and adolescents (24 Nov 2021)  It's important for children to continue to have the recommended childhood vaccines. WHAT SHOULD I DO AND EXPECT AFTER GETTING VACCINATED  Stay at the place where you get vaccinated for at least 15 minutes afterwards, just in case you have an unusual reaction, so health workers can help you.   Check when you should come in for a second dose – if needed. Most of the vaccines available are two-dose vaccines. Check with your care provider whether you need to get a second dose and when you should get it. Second doses help boost the immune response and strengthen immunity.  In most cases, minor side effects are normal. Common side effects after vaccination, which indicate that a person's body is building protection to COVID-19 infection include:  Arm soreness Mild fever Tiredness Headaches Muscle or joint aches   Contact your care provider if there is redness or tenderness (pain) where you got the shot that increases after 24 hours, or if side effects do not go away after a few days.  More serious or long-lasting side effects to COVID-19 vaccines are possible but extremely rare. If you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, loss of speech or mobility after your vaccine, contact your healthcare provider immediately. Vaccines are continually monitored for as long as they are in use to detect and respond to rare adverse events.  You should not get vaccinated if you have a history of severe allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to any of the ingredients of the COVID-19 vaccine, or if you have an allergic reaction to your first dose.   Most side effects go away within a few days on their own. You can manage any side effects with rest, plenty of non-alcoholic liquids and taking medication to manage pain and fever, if needed. We do not recommend taking medication for pain before being vaccinated, as we don’t know how this will affect how well the vaccine works.  Even after you’re vaccinated, keep taking precautions  Continue to take actions to slow and eventually stop the spread of the virus, even after you have been vaccinated:  Keep a safe distance from others and avoid crowds Wear a well-fitting mask covering your mouth and nose When indoors with others, ensure good ventilation, such as by opening a window Clean your hands frequently Cover any cough or sneeze in your bent elbow																
85	1	The speed of development of COVID-19 vaccines was surprising to many, including researchers themselves: Vaccine development often takes a decade or more, but there were a number of factors this time around that made it move at lightning speed. Political commitment and money were no object for countries wanting to control the pandemic as soon as possible. Combined with some of the best scientific minds in the world working towards one common goal, this resulted in an extraordinary level of collaboration and cooperation across borders and between institutions.  It’s important to note that the overwhelming majority of people have mild side effects that are very common for most vaccines – fever, chills, muscle ache, fatigue – which are all signs your immune system is being primed for the real thing. Despite this pace, none of the processes – from finding potential vaccine candidates to getting the vaccine into people’s arms – compromised rigorous safety protocols.   A candidate vaccine goes through several stages before it can be given to people – from the exploratory science, to the pre-clinical testing (often in animals), clinical development (including three phases of human trials), and finally regulatory review and approval, manufacturing and quality control.  Normally, the various clinical trial phases would occur sequentially, with phase 2 following after phase 1, and so on), because of the risk of losing money if a vaccine doesn’t make the cut of the previous round. But given the global urgency for a COVID-19 vaccine, developers took the financial risk and conducted some of these trials in parallel. Similarly, regulatory authorities who would normally have competing priorities that slowed down approval, cleared their desks in order to review COVID-19 vaccine data in record time.  DELIVERING THE VACCINE Once a vaccine has passed clinical trials and been approved for use, the next stage involves getting doses out to countries, where the focus on safety continues. Enormous efforts have been put into investing in cold chain equipment and stock management to ensure that vaccines are kept at the right temperature the whole way through the distribution chain. If they’re not, they have to be discarded.  SAFETY IN REAL-WORLD STUDIES Given some of the news headlines this year associating certain COVID-19 vaccines with blood clots and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), some people may have understandable concerns about side effects. It’s important to note that the overwhelming majority of people have mild side effects that are very common for most vaccines – fever, chills, muscle ache, fatigue – and all signs that your immune system is being primed for the real thing.  The European Medicines Agency concluded earlier this year that blood clots are a very rare side effect of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, affecting four or five people in every one million who receive it. As with all risk, it’s important to put this in perspective – even common everyday medications such as paracetamol can have extremely rare side effects that affect our white blood cells. Also, it’s worth noting that the risk of a serious brain clot associated with COVID-19 infection is ten times higher than the risk of blood clots among people taking the vaccine.  After COVID-19 vaccines were given emergency use authorisation, scientists continue to record side effects and how well the vaccines prevent infection and transmission. Reassuringly, the vaccines’ effectiveness has held up outside of the idealised trial conditions, as has their safety..  The most recent real-world study showing the safety of COVID-19 vaccines was published in late August 2021 in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study, in collaboration with Harvard University, looked at data from more than two million people in Israel, and concluded that serious side effects were very uncommon. Myocarditis, the most serious one, was seen in around 2.7 cases per 100,000 people with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, but this is far outweighed by the massively increased risks associated with COVID-19 infection, including heart arrhythmias (abnormalities of the heart's rhythm), heart attacks, strokes, pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis and acute kidney damage.  Health agencies around the world will continue to monitor vaccine safety for many months to come, both through ongoing analysis of information collected by health data systems, and also through active surveillance in countries where digital record-keeping may be inadequate.																
86	1	Feb. 6—Health experts say COVID-19 vaccinations are key to protecting our community, but many readers have questions.  Our reporters surveyed and spoke to people to identify prevailing concerns, and relayed them to Public Health-Dayton & Montgomery County to get the facts. Those questions and answers are below. Speak to your doctor about whether the vaccine is safe and effective for your family.  Q: If vaccinated people are getting COVID, then it doesn't work, right? Why should I take a vaccine that doesn't work?  Of course some vaccinated people will get COVID because the vaccines are not perfect and not everyone's immune system can respond fully to the vaccine. However, for nearly everyone else, the vaccines are protective against COVID infection.  All currently approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective and reduce your risk of severe illness and death. Vaccination can reduce the spread of disease, which helps protect those who get vaccinated and the people around them. Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalizations has remained high, although it tends to be slightly lower for older adults and for people with weakened immune systems.  Area hospital officials say nearly nine out of 10 of those hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 in the most recent surge and nearly five out of six of the over 370 people who died were unvaccinated.  Q: How many people have been injured or died from the vaccine?  The longstanding Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is being used to track possible COVID-19 side effects. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a proactive system for investigating these side effects, as well as the voluntary V-safe self-reporting system. These monitoring systems are so sensitive that they have identified rare side effects that occur with only a few cases out of a million vaccines.  Serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are rare but might occur. For example, anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination is rare and has occurred in approximately 5 people per 1 million vaccinated in the United States.  The standards for safety for COVID vaccines are rigorous and high. For example, the rare occurrence of side effects with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (such as thrombosis reported in 57 cases out of 18 million J&J doses administered) contributed to the CDC updating its recommendation to prefer Pfizer or Moderna shots over J&J. This further demonstrates that the threshold for safety is high.  The risk of illness, death or long-haul symptoms if an unvaccinated person contracts COVID-19 are much higher than any rare risks of the vaccine.  Q: Was the vaccine rushed? Why did it come out so fast?  While COVID-19 vaccines were developed rapidly, all steps were taken to make sure they are safe and effective:  Scientists have been working for many years to develop vaccines against viruses like the one that causes COVID-19. This knowledge helped speed up the initial development of the current COVID-19 vaccines. All vaccines in the United States must go through three phases of clinical trials to make sure they are safe and effective. During the development of COVID-19 vaccines, phases overlapped to speed up the process, but all phases were completed.  Before vaccines are available, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration assesses the findings from clinical trials. The FDA determined that three COVID-19 vaccines met FDA's safety and effectiveness standards and granted those vaccines Emergency Use Authorizations. This allowed the vaccines to be quickly distributed to control the pandemic. Before recommending COVID-19 vaccination for children, scientists conducted clinical trials.  The FDA gave the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine emergency authorization to use in children 5 to 15 and full approval to use in those 16 and older. This week, the FDA gave the Moderna vaccine full approval for individuals 18 and older.  COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring has been the most intense and comprehensive in U.S. history. Over 540 million vaccine doses have been administered nationwide.. Through several monitoring systems, CDC and FDA continue to provide updated information on the safety of these vaccines.  Q: Are the COVID-19 deaths inflated? Aren't those people really dying from something else and officials are just saying it was COVID?  COVID deaths include all the people who would still be alive if they had not caught COVID at the point in time. People with preexisting conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart and vascular disease and diabetes) are more likely to have worse disease and worse outcomes with any respiratory infections. In COVID deaths, whatever the underlying conditions, it is the COVID infection that tips the balance and causes the deaths.																
87	1	Yes. The two mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna, authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are very safe and very good at preventing serious or fatal cases of COVID-19. The risk of serious side effects associated with these vaccines is very small.  Lisa Maragakis, M.D., M.P.H., senior director of infection prevention, and Gabor Kelen, M.D., director of the Johns Hopkins Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response, answer questions about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines.  COVID-19 Vaccine Safety — What We Know The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are strongly recommended as safe and effective at preventing serious illness or death from COVID-19. From December 2020 to December 2021, about 470 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been given in the U.S. Roughly 12 months of data, including data from tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials, show that the vaccines are safe and effective at preventing serious disease or death due to COVID-19. Additional shots and boosters are also authorized for those who meet the guidelines. mRNA technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines has been in development for over 15 years. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines received full FDA approval, which means more data show how well that particular vaccine works. Due to potential blood clots following administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the CDC updated its recommendations in December 2021. The CDC noted that the two mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, are preferred over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which remains available for those who prefer it and for use in certain circumstances. Are there risks or safety concerns regarding the COVID vaccines? To help catch risks or safety concerns, the CDC and FDA monitor possible safety issues with the COVID-19 vaccines. This ongoing work has led to revised recommendations for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and information about rare side effects tied to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.  Johnson & Johnson/Janssen. In December 2021, the CDC updated its recommendations and stated that either of the two mRNA vaccines is preferred over the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC explained that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are preferred due to a greater risk for developing rare but severe blood clots, called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), following administration of the J&J vaccine. The CDC noted that there are some situations when a J&J vaccine may still be used, if the recipient understands the risks and benefits of the J&J vaccine. Read about side effects related to the rare blood clot. At Johns Hopkins Medicine, we offer Pfizer and Moderna vaccines throughout our vaccine clinics. We have a limited supply of J&J vaccine and only offer it by request and if the recipient clearly understands the risks and benefits.  Pfizer and Moderna. After observing rare occurrences of myocarditis following the second injection of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC released information for the public. Most of these myocarditis events happened in teens and young adults, and the majority of the cases were mild and cleared up on their own. Read about side effects related to myocarditis. This review process continues to monitor vaccine safety. Potential risks of COVID-19 vaccines are reviewed and weighed against the benefits of protection that the vaccines offer as well as the known, serious risk of harm due to COVID-19.  What if I got a J&J vaccine? Should I worry about blood clots? If you received a Johnson & Johnson vaccine more than three weeks ago, you do not need to watch for side effects related to blood clots.  If you received the J&J vaccine within the last three weeks, you should watch for possible symptoms of TTS and get medical help immediately if you have any of the following:  Severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision Shortness of breath Chest pain Leg swelling Persistent abdominal pain Easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin near the injection site Is there a risk of an allergic reaction to a COVID vaccine? According to the CDC, anyone who has a severe allergy (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any of the mRNA vaccine ingredients should not receive this vaccine. The CDC says people with allergies to certain foods, insects, latex and other common allergens can safely receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Those with a history of severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to injectables or other vaccines should discuss the vaccination with their doctor, who can evaluate and assess their risk.  The COVID-19 Vaccines: What you need to know | Las vacunas anticovid-19: información imprescindible  How was the COVID-19 vaccine developed so quickly? The relatively quick development of these vaccines does not mean safety measures were skipped. There are several reasons why the COVID-19 vaccines were developed faster than other vaccines:  The technologies used to develop the COVID-19 vaccines have been in development for years to prepare for outbreaks of infectious viruses. The manufacturing processes were ready very early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries shared genetic information when it was available about SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, which gave vaccine developers an early start at finding a vaccine. The testing processes for the vaccines didn’t skip any steps, but the vaccine developers conducted some stages of the process simultaneously to gather as much data as quickly as possible. Governments gave money to vaccine developers in advance, so the companies had resources they needed. Some types of COVID-19 vaccines were created using messenger RNA (mRNA), a new technology that allows a faster approach than the traditional way vaccines are made. Social media enabled companies to reach out to and enroll study volunteers, and plenty of people wanted to help, so there were enough research participants to test the COVID-19 vaccines. Because SARS-CoV-2 is so contagious and widespread, many volunteers who got the vaccines were exposed to the virus, and with so many exposures, it took a shorter time to see if the vaccines worked. Companies began manufacturing vaccines ahead of their authorization or approval so some supplies would be ready if authorization occurred. What steps are taken to help make sure the COVID-19 vaccines are safe? Safety is always a top priority as federal agencies work with vaccine manufacturers and independent scientific organizations to develop, study, authorize and approve new vaccines. Here are some of the steps taken for COVID-19 vaccines, as well as other vaccines:  Careful testing. All vaccines go through clinical trials to test safety and effectiveness. For the COVID-19 vaccine, the FDA set high safety standards for vaccine developers to meet. This graphic from the National Institutes of Health shows the four phases a vaccine goes through before it is released to the public. Authorization for emergency use. If a vaccine or medicine is needed to address an emergency situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic, once it is shown to be safe and effective, the FDA can grant it an emergency use authorization (EUA). An EUA allows a vaccine, treatment or medication to be used before the formal FDA approval. Continuous monitoring for problems and side effects. Once a vaccine gets an EUA and is being given to people, the FDA and the CDC continue to watch carefully in case problems arise. Data on the vaccine’s safety record accumulates over time, as more and more people who receive it report on their experience and any side effects. One important way to report adverse events after vaccination is through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Learn more from the CDC about the safety steps for the COVID-19 vaccine.  Demographics of the COVID-19 Vaccine Trials  Do I still have to wear a mask if I get a vaccine? The CDC continues to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and makes recommendations for wearing face masks, both for those who are fully vaccinated as well as people who are not fully vaccinated.  The CDC also recommends that masks and physical distancing be required when going to a doctor’s office, hospital or long-term care facility, including all Johns Hopkins hospitals, care centers and offices.  Johns Hopkins Medicine’s mask safety guidelines have not changed, and we still require everyone to wear masks inside all of our facilities.  Can I get COVID-19 from the vaccine? You cannot and will not get COVID-19 from any of the vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines do not have any virus or other infectious material in them.  What about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination for diverse groups of people?  The FDA and other reviewers closely consider diverse populations and include them in the trials. The clinical trials for the first two COVID-19 vaccines included members of underrepresented minorities and older age groups, and people with conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and heart and respiratory conditions.  Does Johns Hopkins Medicine recommend that I get a COVID-19 vaccine? Yes, we recommend that everyone who is eligible get vaccinated with one of the currently authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines: Pfizer or Moderna. We view both as highly effective in preventing serious disease, hospitalization and death from COVID-19 (including disease caused by the very contagious delta and omicron variants of the coronavirus), and we believe that their benefits outweigh their risks.  At Johns Hopkins Medicine, we offer Pfizer and Moderna vaccines throughout our vaccine clinics. We have a limited supply of J&J vaccine and only offer it by request and if the recipient clearly understands the risks and benefits.																
88	1	In his nearly 30 years studying vaccines, Paul Goepfert, M.D., director of the Alabama Vaccine Research Clinic at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, has never seen any vaccine as effective as the three COVID vaccines — from Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson — currently available in the United States.   “A 90 percent decrease in risk of infections, and 94 percent effectiveness against hospitalization for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is fantastic,” he said.   But what makes vaccine experts such as Goepfert confident that COVID vaccines are safe in the long term? We have all seen billboards and TV infomercials from law firms seeking people harmed by diet drugs or acid-reflux medicines for class-action lawsuits. What makes Goepfert think that scientists would not discover previously unsuspected problems caused by COVID vaccines in the years ahead?   There are several reasons, actually. Vaccines, given in one- or two-shot doses, are very different from medicines that people take every day, potentially for years. And decades of vaccine history — plus data from more than a billion people who have received COVID vaccines starting last December — provide powerful proof that there is little chance that any new dangers will emerge from COVID vaccines.   The majority of Americans who have not been vaccinated — or who say they are hesitant about vaccinating their children — report that safety is their main concern. Nearly a quarter of respondents in Gallup surveys in March and April 2021 said they wanted to confirm the vaccine was safe before getting the shot. And 26 percent of respondents in a survey of parents with children ages 12-15 by the Kaiser Family Foundation in April 2021 said they wanted to “wait a while to see how the vaccine is working” before deciding to get their child vaccinated.   But Goepfert says we already know enough to be confident the COVID vaccines are safe. Here is why, starting with the way vaccines work and continuing through strong evidence from vaccine history and the even stronger evidence from the responses of people who have received COVID-19 vaccines worldwide over the past six months.  Vaccines are eliminated quickly Unlike many medications, which are taken daily, vaccines are generally one-and-done. Medicines you take every day can cause side effects that reveal themselves over time, including long-term problems as levels of the drug build up in the body over months and years.   “Vaccines are just designed to deliver a payload and then are quickly eliminated by the body,” Goepfert said. “This is particularly true of the mRNA vaccines. mRNA degrades incredibly rapidly. You wouldn’t expect any of these vaccines to have any long-term side effects. And in fact, this has never occurred with any vaccine.”  Vaccine side effects show up within weeks if at all That is not to say that there have never been safety issues with vaccines. But in each instance, these have appeared soon after widespread use of the vaccine began.   “The side effects that we see occur early on, and that’s it,” Goepfert said. “In virtually all cases, vaccine side effects are seen within the first two months after rollout.”  From side, Dr. Kierstin Kennedy, MD (Associate Professor, Hospitalist Service) is wearing blue scrubs and a fabric face mask while receiving the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease) vaccination from a female healthcare worker wearing scrubs and a PPE face mask and gloves, December 2020.  The only vaccine program that might compare with the scale and speed of the COVID rollout is the original oral polio vaccine in the 1950s. When this vaccine was first introduced in the United States in 1955, it used a weakened form of the polio virus that in very rare cases — about one in 2.4 million recipients — became activated and caused paralysis. (Compare this with the 60,000 children infected with polio in the United States in 1952, and the more than 3,000 children who died from the disease in the United States that year.) Cases of vaccine-induced paralysis occurred between one and four weeks after vaccination. None of the COVID vaccines uses a weakened form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus — all train the body to recognize a piece of the virus known as the spike protein and generate antibodies that can attack the virus in case of a real infection.  In 1976, a vaccine against swine flu that was widely distributed in the United States was identified in rare cases (approximately one in 100,000) as a cause of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, in which the immune system attacks the nerves. Almost all of these cases occurred in the eight weeks after a person received the vaccine. But the flu itself also can cause Guillain-Barré Syndrome; in fact, the syndrome occurs 17 times more frequently after natural flu infection than after vaccination.  COVID vaccine experience over the past six months “By the time the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines were approved for emergency use in the United States in December 2020, we already knew the short-term side effects very well from the efficacy studies,” Goepfert said. “Pfizer and Moderna — and later Johnson & Johnson and then Novavax, which reported on its phase III trial results in June 2021 — all have enrolled 30,000-plus individuals, half of whom got the vaccine and half of whom got a placebo initially, after which all the placebo group got the vaccine.  From side, a Black female healthcare worker is wearing PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) face mask and gloves as she vaccinates a Black male at the UAB COVID-19 Vaccination Site at Parker High School.   The side effects seen in these studies, and again in the nationwide rollouts that began in December 2020, were tolerability issues, Goepfert says, mainly arm pain, fatigue and headache. These are very transient, and occur a day or two days after the vaccine. They then resolve quickly.   As of June 12, 2021, more than 2.33 billion COVID vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, according to the New York Times vaccinations tracker.   Goepfert says that, between December and June, we began to see the more-rare side effects that do not show up until millions of people have gotten the vaccine.    About one in 100,000 people receiving the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine have experienced a clotting disorder known as thrombotic thrombocytopenia, including 79 cases among more than 20 million people receiving this vaccine in the United Kingdom, and 19 deaths. A smaller number of cases have occurred with Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine as well, Goepfert says.   “The causes are still being worked out; but when this happens, it occurs from six days to two weeks after vaccination,” he said. “More recently, an even more rare side effect — myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle — has been reported in people receiving Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. That is about one in a million, or possibly higher rates in some populations; but again, all of these occur no more than a month after the vaccination.”  On July 12, 2021, the FDA announced that in rare cases (100 reports out of 12.8 million shots given in the United States), the J&J vaccine is associated with Guillan-Barré syndrome. The cases were mostly reported two weeks after injection and mostly in men age 50 and older.  Weighing the odds Any risk is frightening, especially for a parent. But the rare side effects identified with COVID vaccines have to be weighed against the known, higher risks from contracting COVID, Goepfert says. It is not clear how COVID variants such as the highly infectious Delta mutation may affect patients. Early indications are that Delta infections bring more severe side effects than other forms of COVID, but that vaccines are still protective against Delta.  It is COVID infection, and the growing evidence of persistent symptoms from what has become known as “long COVID,” that are the most troubling unknown out there, Goepfert says.   “The long-term side effects of COVID infection are a major concern,” Goepfert said. “Up to 10 percent of people who have COVID experience side effects such as difficulty thinking, pain, tiredness, loss of taste and depression. We don’t know why that is, how long these symptoms will last or if there are effective ways to treat them. That is the most troubling unknown for me.”   Even as cases, hospitalizations and deaths have declined significantly in Alabama since January, there are still nearly 250 new COVID cases diagnosed and nearly 10 deaths reported statewide per day as of mid-June   “Many people worry that these vaccines were ‘rushed’ into use and still do not have full FDA approval — they are currently being distributed under Emergency Use Authorizations,” Goepfert said. “But because we have had so many people vaccinated, we actually have far more safety data than we have had for any other vaccine, and these COVID vaccines have an incredible safety track record. There should be confidence in that.”																
89	1	"More than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine.  There are different approved types and brands available and all have undergone rigorous testing and safety checks.  How do we know a vaccine is safe? Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies.  The principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.  When will I get a coronavirus vaccine? What role do trials have? If the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective.  That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.  Half are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.   Media caption, BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently.  The Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside.  Who approves vaccines or treatments? Approval is only given if regulators are happy that a vaccine is safe and effective.  Checks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks.  In the UK, independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it after approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.  What is the fast-track approval for vaccines against new variants? Scientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.  The UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.  No corners will be cut, with safety paramount.  But lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.  Instead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.  What's in the Covid vaccines? Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines.  They do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.  The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.  Vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.  Will the vaccine give me side effects? Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.  Some people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.  Common reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.  What about serious reactions? It is rare to find that health problems occurring following a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Events may be coincidental and unrelated to vaccination.  The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. This is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too.  The chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK have been offered alternative Covid vaccines.  What about allergies? Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.  There have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.  As a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab.  Be aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation).  How the vaccines compare? What if I've already had Covid? People will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid in the past.  That's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.  Guidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with ""long"" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered.  How animal-friendly are vaccines and do they contain alcohol? Some vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine.  The Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.  The British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example."																
90	1	One of the reasons some people haven’t signed up to receive the COVID-19 vaccine is that they’re worried there might be unknown side effects that will show up months or years later.  Although it’s true there are still a lot of things we’re learning about the vaccines — like how effective they are against variants and how long their protection lasts — there are plenty of things we do know that give experts confidence in the long-term safety of the vaccines.  History tells us that severe side effects are extremely rare, and if they do occur, they usually happen within the first two months. The most recent example of this phenomenon is the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine was put on pause when health officials learned that a small number of people who received the vaccine experienced a serious blood clotting problem.  About 7.4 million Americans had received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine when regulators paused its administration to investigate a handful of cases in which people had blood clots. All of the cases emerged within two weeks of vaccination.  Upon reviewing information about the cases, federal health officials determined that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk, and they approved resumed use of the vaccine.   This is how the system is designed to work if unexpected side effects emerge.  History shows this is a common pattern. When new vaccines are released, the unknown side effects, if any, show up within two months of vaccination. This history goes back to at least the 1960s with the oral polio vaccine and examples continue through today.  Because of this, scientists and public health officials continually monitor vaccine data before, during and after a vaccine becomes available to the public.  COVID-19 vaccine technologies have been studied for years and used in other treatments without issue. mRNA vaccines. The vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to deliver a message to your immune system with instructions on how to fight the coronavirus infection.  Researchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades. mRNA vaccines have been studied before for influenza, Zika and rabies. Beyond vaccines, cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells. Learn more about how mRNA vaccines work.  Adenovector vaccines. Viral vector vaccines use a modified version of a different virus (the vector) to deliver instructions that teach cells how to fight the coronavirus infection. In the case of the COVID-19 case, it’s the adenovirus, a common virus that causes colds or flu-like symptoms. However, the adenovirus was modified so it can enter cells but can’t replicate or cause illness.  Scientists began creating viral vectors in the 1970s, and they have been studied for gene therapy and cancer treatment. Some vaccines recently used for Ebola outbreaks have used viral vector technology, and studies have focused on viral vector vaccines against other infectious diseases such as Zika, influenza and HIV. Learn more about how the Johnson & Johnson vaccine works.  The vaccine development process, from clinical trials to ongoing monitoring, helps to uncover and understand side effects. Clinical trials are a key part of vaccine development and involve evaluating use in tens of thousands of study participants. All of the COVID-19 vaccines went through this rigorous process before authorization.  In reviewing results from the trials, the federal Food and Drug Administration must determine that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine.   After vaccines are authorized and in use by the public, public health officials continue monitoring the data as an additional safety measure. Manufacturers must have a plan to report follow-up data, including any events such as hospitalizations and deaths, and they must continue research to generate more data on safety and efficacy. Learn more about FDA emergency use authorization.																
91	1	"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, you might have questions about COVID-19 vaccines. Find out about the different types of COVID-19 vaccines, how they work, the possible side effects, and the benefits for you and your family.  Let's set the record straight on some of the myths circulating about COVID-19 vaccines. Myth: The COVID-19 vaccine is not safe because it was rapidly developed and tested. Fact: Because there is an urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines and the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) vaccine approval process can take years, the FDA first gave emergency use authorization to COVID-19 vaccines based on less data than is typically required. The data must show that the vaccines are safe and effective before the FDA can give emergency use authorization or approval.  Vaccines with FDA emergency use authorization or approval include: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine  The FDA has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, now called Comirnaty, to prevent COVID-19 in people age 16 and older. The FDA approved Comirnaty after data found the vaccine is safe and effective. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is 91% effective in preventing the COVID-19 virus with symptoms in people age 16 and older.  The vaccine is still under an emergency use authorization for children ages 12–15. The vaccine is 100% effective in preventing COVID-19 in children ages 12–15. It requires two shots given 21 days apart. The second dose can be given up to six weeks after the first dose, if needed.  The vaccine is now also available under an emergency use authorization for children ages 5–11. This vaccine is about 91% effective in preventing COVID-19 in children ages 5–11. It requires two shots, given 21 days apart. It also contains a lower dose than the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine used for people age 12 and older.  Moderna COVID-19 vaccine  The FDA has approved the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, now called Spikevax, to prevent COVID-19 in people age 18 and older. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is 94% effective in preventing the COVID-19 virus with symptoms. It requires two shots given 28 days apart. The second dose can be given up to six weeks after the first dose, if needed.  Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine  In clinical trials, this vaccine was 66% effective in preventing the COVID-19 virus with symptoms — as of 14 days after vaccination. The vaccine also was 85% effective at preventing severe disease with the COVID-19 virus — at least 28 days after vaccination. This vaccine is authorized for people age 18 and older. It requires one shot. If you are given this vaccine, learn about the possible risks and symptoms of a blood-clotting problem.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends getting a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine over getting the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. But getting any COVID-19 vaccine is better than not getting a COVID-19 vaccine.  Myth: I already had COVID-19 and I have recovered, so I don't need to get a COVID-19 vaccine when it's available. Fact: Getting COVID-19 might offer some natural protection or immunity from reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-19. It's estimated that getting COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination both result in a low risk of another infection with a similar variant for at least six months. But because reinfection is possible and COVID-19 can cause severe medical complications, it’s recommended that people who have already had COVID-19 get a COVID-19 vaccine. A recent study showed that unvaccinated people who already had COVID-19 are more than twice as likely as fully vaccinated people to be reinfected with COVID-19.  Recent research also suggests that people who got COVID-19 in 2020 and then received mRNA vaccines produce very high levels of antibodies that are likely effective against current and, possibly, future variants. Some scientists call this hybrid immunity. Further research is needed.  If you were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, there is no need to delay getting a COVID-19 vaccine.  Myth: There are severe side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines. Fact: While many people do not have reactions after vaccination, it is normal if you do. It does not mean you have the COVID-19 infection. It is an indicator that your immune system is responding to the vaccine. If you have a reaction, take some time to rest and allow your body to recover.  A COVID-19 vaccine can cause mild side effects after the first or second dose, including:  Pain, redness or swelling where the shot was given Fever Fatigue Headache Muscle pain Chills Joint pain Nausea and vomiting Feeling unwell Swollen lymph nodes You'll be monitored for 15 minutes after getting a COVID-19 vaccine to see if you have an allergic reaction.  Most side effects go away in a few days. Side effects after the second dose might be more intense. Many people have no side effects. Side effects of booster shots appear to be similar to side effects experienced after the two-dose or single-dose primary shots. If the redness or tenderness where the shot was given gets worse after 24 hours or you are concerned about any side effects, contact your doctor.  Myth: The COVID-19 vaccines don't work because you can still get COVID after vaccination. Fact: COVID-19 vaccination will protect most people from getting sick with COVID-19. But some fully vaccinated people will still get COVID-19. These are called vaccine breakthrough infections.  People with vaccine breakthrough infections can spread COVID-19 to others. However, fully vaccinated people with a breakthrough infection are less likely to have serious illness with COVID-19 than those who are unvaccinated. Even when vaccinated people develop symptoms, they tend to be less severe than those experienced by unvaccinated people.  Myth: The current COVID-19 vaccines don't protect against the COVID-19 variants. Fact: Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified two variants of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as variants of concern:  Delta (B.1.617.2). This variant is nearly twice as contagious as earlier variants and might cause more severe illness. The greatest risk of transmission is among unvaccinated people. People who are fully vaccinated can get vaccine breakthrough infections and spread the virus to others. However, it appears that fully vaccinated people spread COVID-19 for a shorter period than do unvaccinated people. While research suggests that COVID-19 vaccines are slightly less effective against the delta variant, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines still appear to provide protection against severe COVID-19. Omicron (B.1.1.529). This variant spreads more easily than the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the delta variant. However, omicron appears to cause less severe disease. People who are fully vaccinated can get breakthrough infections and spread the virus to others. However, the COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing severe illness. This variant also reduces the effectiveness of some monoclonal antibody treatments. Myth: Most people don’t need a COVID-19 booster shot. Fact: An additional primary shot of a COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for people who are vaccinated and might not have had a strong enough immune response.  In contrast, a booster dose is recommended for people who are vaccinated and whose immune response weakened over time. Research suggests that getting a booster dose can decrease your risk of infection and severe illness with COVID-19.  People who have a moderately or severely weakened immune system should get an additional primary shot and a booster shot.  The CDC recommends additional primary shots and booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines in specific instances:  Additional dose The CDC recommends an additional primary shot of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for some people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have had an organ transplant. People with weakened immune systems might not develop enough immunity after vaccination with two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or one dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. An additional shot using an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine might improve their protection against COVID-19. The additional primary shot should be given at least 28 days after a second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or one dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine The additional primary shot should be the same brand as the other two mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses that were given. If the brand given isn't known, either brand of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine can be given as a third dose. Booster dose Booster doses are recommended for people age 12 and older after getting two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or one dose of a Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. You can get a booster if you received: Pfizer Are age 12 and older and it's been at least five months after completing the primary series. The Pfizer or Moderna booster vaccines are preferred for most people ages 18 and older. Ages 12–17 may only get a Pfizer booster. Are age 5–11, it's been at least 28 days after completing the primary series, and you are moderately or severely immunocompromised Moderna Are age 18 and older and it's been at least five months after completing the primary series Johnson & Johnson Are age 18 and older and it's been at least two months after receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccination The Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine boosters are preferred in most situations.  Pregnant women also can get a COVID-19 booster shot.  If you have a weakened immune system, had two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and an additional primary shot, and it’s been at least three months since the additional shot, get a single booster dose. An mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is preferred.  If you have a weakened immune system, had one dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine and an additional primary shot of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and it’s been at least two months since the additional shot, get a single booster dose. An mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is preferred.  Myth: People with existing health conditions should not get a COVID-19 vaccine. Fact: COVID-19 vaccines are safe for people who have existing health conditions, including conditions that increase the risk of severe illness with COVID-19. People who have a moderately or severely weakened immune system should get an additional primary shot and a booster shot.  Myth: Children can't get severely sick with COVID-19, so they don't need a COVID-19 vaccine. Fact: A COVID-19 vaccine can prevent your child from getting COVID-19 and spreading it at home and in school.  If your child gets COVID-19, a COVID-19 vaccine could prevent severe illness. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can also help keep your child in school and more safely have playdates and participate in sports and other group activities.  Myth: I won't need to wear a mask after I get vaccinated for COVID-19. Fact: You are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after you get a second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or two weeks after you get a single dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.  You are considered up to date with your vaccine if you gotten all recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including booster doses, when you be eligible.  After getting fully vaccinated, you can more safely return to doing activities that you might not have been able to do because of the pandemic.  However, if you are in an area with a high number of new COVID-19 cases, the CDC recommends wearing a mask indoors in public and outdoors in crowded areas or when you are in close contact with unvaccinated people. If you are fully vaccinated and have a condition or are taking medications that weaken your immune system, you may need to keep wearing a mask.  You also will still be required to wear a mask on planes, buses, trains and other public transportation traveling to, within, or out of the U.S., as well as in places such as airports and train stations.  If you are traveling in the U.S., you don't need to get tested before or after your trip or quarantine after you return. If you are traveling outside of the U.S., you don't need to get tested before you leave the U.S. unless your destination requires it. You still need to show a negative test result or proof that you've recovered from COVID-19 in the past three months before boarding an international flight to the U.S.  If you've gotten all recommended vaccine doses, including boosters and additional primary shots, and you've had close contact with someone who has the COVID-19 virus, get tested at least five days after the contact happens.  Myth: The COVID-19 vaccine was developed to control the general population either through microchip tracking or ""nanotransducers"" in our brains. Fact: There is no vaccine microchip, and the vaccine will not track people or gather personal information into a database.  This myth started after comments made by Bill Gates from The Gates Foundation about a digital certificate of vaccine records. The technology he was referencing is not a microchip, has not been implemented in any manner and is not tied to the development, testing or distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.  Myth: COVID-19 vaccines will alter my DNA. Fact: The first COVID-19 vaccines to reach the market were messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. According to the CDC, mRNA vaccines work by instructing cells in the body how to make a protein that triggers an immune response. Injecting mRNA into your body will not interact or do anything to the DNA of your cells. Human cells break down and get rid of the mRNA soon after they have finished using the instructions.  Myth: COVID-19 vaccines were manufactured using fetal tissue. Fact: Neither the Pfizer/BioNTech nor Moderna vaccines for COVID-19 contain fetal cells, and fetal cells were not used in their development or production.  In two animal studies, researchers performed laboratory testing of the vaccines using historically harvested fetal cell lines. However, both animal studies were conducted after these vaccines were already in phase 3 clinical trials.  Myth: COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility or miscarriage. Fact: It's recommended that you get a COVID-19 vaccine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant or might become pregnant in the future. There is no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems in men or women.  It's not clear if getting COVID-19 or a COVID-19 vaccine causes changes in menstruation. A new study of about 4,000 people suggest that getting a COVID-19 vaccine is linked with a less than one-day change in menstrual cycle length for each does.  Keep in mind that many things can affect menstrual cycles, including infections, stress, sleep problems and changes in diet or exercise.  Myth: Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not get the COVID-19 vaccine. Fact: If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, it's recommended that you get a COVID-19 vaccine. The overall risk of COVID-19 to pregnant women is low. However, women who are pregnant or were recently pregnant are at increased risk of severe illness with COVID-19. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can protect you from severe illness due to COVID-19. Vaccination can also help pregnant women build antibodies that might protect their babies.  COVID-19 vaccines don't cause infection with the COVID-19 virus, including in pregnant women or their babies. None of the COVID-19 vaccines contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. Also, keep in mind that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines don't alter your DNA.  Findings from a study of more than 40,000 women show that getting a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy poses no serious risks for pregnant women who were vaccinated or their babies. Most of the women in the study received an mRNA vaccine. (24) In addition, vaccines that use the same viral vector as the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine have been given to pregnant women in each trimester of pregnancy in clinical trials. No harmful effects were found.  Myth: I am allergic to eggs so I shouldn't get the COVID-19 vaccine Fact: Neither the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine nor the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines contain egg nor were eggs used the development or production of either vaccine. However, those with severe allergic reactions to eggs or any other substance (i.e., anaphylaxis) are encouraged to remain after vaccination for 30 minutes for observation.  Myth: COVID-19 vaccines must be stored at extremely low temperatures because of preservatives in the vaccines. Fact: Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have reported that their vaccines contain no preservatives.  Different vaccines have different storage requirements. For instance, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine must be stored at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 70 degrees Celsius), while Moderna has said that its vaccine needs to be stored at minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 20 degrees Celsius). Both of these vaccines use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to teach your cells how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response to COVID-19. However, messenger RNA is fragile and can break down easily. Storing messenger RNA vaccines, like these COVID-19 vaccines, in an ultracold environment keeps them stable and safe.  You should not worry about these temperatures. Vaccines are thawed before injection."																
92	1	The development of a COVID-19 (coronavirus) vaccine is essential in the fight to bring the current pandemic to an end. With the speed at which development is progressing, there are some questions over how safe any vaccines will be once they are produced. In this article we’ll go over the main concerns related to the safety of the new coronavirus vaccine candidates.  How do the coronavirus vaccines work? Vaccines work by harmlessly introducing elements of a disease to the body to teach it how to fight specific infections.  Coronavirus vaccine research Before a vaccine can be made, researchers have to understand how coronavirus attacks the body. When creating a prospective vaccine, scientists first have to understand how the coronavirus attacks the body. The vaccine developers can then take genetic material from the coronavirus and use it to create a vaccine that appears to the body in the same way the virus would.  This is injected into the patient, stimulating an adaptive immune response where the body creates antibodies that can fight coronavirus. Antibodies are a type of blood protein used by the body to fight infection, so if the patient comes into contact with coronavirus, their body will already know how to fight it.  Coronavirus vaccine candidate When a viable vaccine candidate has been created, it should create immunity from coronavirus in the patient. There are currently four coronavirus vaccines approved for use in the UK, the Oxford/Astrazeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.  The  coronavirus vaccine works by taking a lesser virus (similar to a common cold) and manipulating it so it is no longer harmful. The manipulated virus acquires the surface features which mimic coronavirus, appearing to the body in the same way and triggering the creation of coronavirus antibodies. The Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine is based upon a similar principle.  Other vaccines use synthetic DNA to teach the body how to create the proteins which can fight coronavirus and create immunity, such as the vaccine developed by American biotechnology company . The vaccine produced by the collaboration between American pharmaceutical giant, , and the German biotechnology company, , also uses synthetic DNA technology.  Coronavirus vaccine antibodies Patients who recieve the vaccine will then have the antibodies that can fight coronavirus. Vaccines can be created in many different ways, but ultimately all vaccines allow your immune system to learn how to fight infection and gain immunity. It is far safer to gain immunity through vaccination than it is by catching a potentially life-threatening disease.  How can a vaccine be made in months when it usually takes years? There are over 70 coronavirus vaccines currently being tested in clinical trials all over the world, and many of the frontrunners in the race to make the coronavirus vaccine have created vaccines using established platforms. This means that the vaccine developers have a specific method of creating vaccines which can be applied to similar viruses.  Some of the vaccine candidates (such as the one developed by the University of Oxford) have already been , such as SARS and MERS. Previous research and vaccine development with similar coronaviruses has made the process of creating a COVID-19 vaccine much faster.  If similar technology used with previous coronaviruses has been successful, it is also a good indication that it will be successful with COVID-19 too.  Another factor in the speed of the coronavirus vaccine development is the increase in funding and resources. Owing to the severity of the pandemic and its repercussions, a lot more funding that usual has been dedicated to vaccine development. As a result, progress has been made a lot faster than it would under other circumstances.  How can they make a vaccine for coronavirus when there aren’t yet vaccines for viruses like HIV? Creating vaccines for different viruses can be very different. Although HIV affects many people all over the world, the complexity with which the virus affects the body makes it difficult to develop a vaccine that can guarantee immunity.  By contrast, the COVID-19 coronavirus attacks the body in a different way. After early progress was made in understanding the structure of the virus and sequencing its genetic information, efforts to create the vaccine could already begin.  There has also been an unprecedented cross collaboration between biotechnology firms, pharmaceutical companies, public organisations and government agencies around the world in the work to create a functioning coronavirus vaccine.  How are the coronavirus vaccines tested to ensure they are safe? All candidates for the coronavirus vaccine will pass through a rigorous testing process to ensure that they work properly and are safe.  Once a vaccine candidate is ready, it must pass through three phases of clinical trials. In the first phase, a small group of volunteers is given the vaccine to ensure the vaccine is safe and has no adverse side effects.  Once the vaccine is established to be safe, testing can move on to the second phase, in which a larger group is given the vaccine. This second group of volunteers should be of different ages and backgrounds to mimic how the vaccine might work for different people. The phase of testing will establish whether the vaccine is efficient in creating immunity against the coronavirus.  The third phase involves testing on an even larger group of volunteers to ensure the efficiency and safety of the vaccine on wider society.  Only then can a vaccine be approved for distribution to the general public.  How many people have taken the coronavirus vaccine in clinical trials? Over 44,000 volunteers have participated in clinical trials for the Pfizer/ BioNTech vaccine, more than 40,000 in the clinical trial for the , and 30,000 in the clinical trial for another mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna.  In any given clinical trial, will receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and the rest are given a placebo (a vaccine for a different disease). Of the people who were given the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, none experienced significant or severe lasting side effects that can be attributed to the vaccine, which is why it has been judged as safe for wider distribution.  Were there any deaths during the clinical trials of the coronavirus vaccine? There have been deaths in the clinical trials for different coronavirus vaccines, but none that were out of the ordinary for such a large number of people.  For example, in the Pfizer/BioNTech clinical trial 6 people died out of 44,000 people. Of these 6 people, . The two people who received the vaccine were over 55, one of which died from cardiac arrest more than 3 months after receiving the vaccine, and the other a few days after receiving the vaccine from arteriosclerosis, a condition that causes blood vessels to thicken and harden with age.  According to  “all deaths represent events that occur in the general population of the age groups where they occurred, at a similar rate”. This means that within a group of 44,000, it could also be expected that the same number of deaths might occur, regardless as to whether they had been vaccinated or not.  Does the coronavirus vaccine have side effects? In some people the coronavirus vaccine will have mild side effects, similar to that of other vaccines.  Find out more about the .  Will the vaccine be mandatory? Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that the COVID-19 vaccine will not be made mandatory, however, it is possible that it will be for front line health professionals who are at high risk and working with vulnerable patients.																
93	1	The arrival of the COVID-19 vaccine marked a big step toward getting back to the people and places we’ve missed for so long. But you may have heard different things about them from friends and family, social media, or the news. So, what are the facts? Here’s how we know the vaccine is safe and effective, according to medical experts.  The COVID-19 vaccine was safely developed The COVID-19 vaccine began rolling out less than a year into the pandemic. Vaccine development typically takes much longer, so it’s easy to wonder how we got this vaccine so soon. But the COVID-19 vaccine is held to the same safety standards as any other vaccine. Rigorous clinical trials have proven that they’re safe and effective.     The accelerated COVID-19 vaccine timeline The COVID-19 vaccine went through the same process as any other vaccine — only faster.   The accelerated COVID-19 vaccine timeline graphic The public health emergency fast-tracked vaccine development We knew early on that COVID-19 was extremely serious and spreading fast. The world needed a safe, effective vaccine as soon as possible. Here’s how we did it:     handshake icon Widespread collaboration Scientists and medical experts around the world joined forces and shared resources. By working together, they developed the COVID-19 vaccine as quickly as possible.      dollar sign icon Unprecedented funding The government spared no expense responding to COVID-19. A lot of money and resources went into making the vaccine, so more could get done in less time.     group of people icon High numbers of research volunteers Finding volunteers for clinical trials is usually hard. But in this case, it was easy. When it came to COVID-19, people wanted to help. Researchers had a robust sample size almost immediately.       calendar icon Early results Because COVID-19 spreads so fast, we had a huge amount of data much faster than usual. It didn’t take long for researchers to prove the vaccine works.     vaccine icon Front-end manufacturing Vaccine manufacturers don’t often start production until clinical trials are complete. But with the pandemic surging, they scaled up to make vaccines as soon as they got approved.     microscope icon Established research The COVID-19 vaccine is new, but the technology behind them is not. Research to develop new vaccines in case of a pandemic had been underway for decades. So, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, scientists were well prepared. They put years of vaccine technology to work and tailored it to specifically fight the coronavirus.         Data proves the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective The COVID-19 vaccine is among the safest, most effective vaccines ever. No vaccine is 100% effective — and they don’t need to be to save lives.  Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are more than 94% effective against COVID-19.1,2 And the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is shown to be 85% effective in preventing severe cases of COVID-19.3  For perspective, let's compare the COVID-19 vaccine to seasonal flu shots. Seasonal flu shots are only 40% to 60% effective. In the 2019–2020 flu season alone, they prevented about 6,300 people from dying. Flu shots also prevented around 7.52 million illnesses and 105,000 hospital stays.4   Now consider this: All 3 versions of the COVID-19 vaccine are more effective than a seasonal flu shot. Imagine how many illnesses, hospital stays, and deaths the COVID-19 vaccine will stop. woman on laptop       COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness data is open to the public All the data published by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is posted online and open for everyone to review. Below you can see how each version of the vaccine works — and why we know they’re safe:  Pfizer vaccine Moderna vaccine Johnson & Johnson vaccine       COVID-19 vaccine side effects are usually minor and manageable  Like most vaccines, the COVID-19 vaccine can produce side effects. These side effects are normal signs that the body is building immunity. They may include:  Pain at the injection site  Fatigue  Headache  Muscle pain  Chills  Joint pain  Fever  It’s important to remember that all vaccines carry risks for side effects. But these risks must be weighed against the benefits. COVID-19 is dangerous — anyone can develop life-threatening complications if they get it. The good news: The FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any risks for side effects.       nurse giving man a shot Specific vaccine concerns and considerations Even though it’s extremely rare, allergic reactions can occur. Talk to your doctor before getting vaccinated if: You have a history of severe allergic reactions  You carry an epinephrine injector (such as an EpiPen)5 You have any questions or concerns about allergies or any other health conditions Don’t get a vaccine with ingredients that have given you a severe allergic reaction in the past. If you find you’re allergic to a certain type of vaccine, do not get another dose of that vaccine.6  Visit the  CDC website to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine for people who have allergies. If you have questions or concerns about allergies or other health issues, talk to your doctor. Your doctor can help you decide if getting vaccinated is the right choice for you.  You can’t get COVID-19 from the vaccine The COVID-19 vaccine doesn’t introduce the virus into your body. It only teaches your body how to recognize the coronavirus. This helps your body create antibodies to fight the virus in case you ever get it. Since no trace of coronavirus is in the vaccine, it's impossible to get COVID-19 from the vaccine.																
94	1	Millions of Americans have safely gotten vaccinated against COVID-19. However, because these vaccines are relatively new and the target of misinformation online, there may be apprehension about vaccine safety and efficacy.  We’ve asked our Yale New Haven Health experts to help clarify what we know about the vaccines and their current safety profiles.  What Do We Know About the Safety of the Available Vaccines? All of the data that are available indicate that the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are safe. The Pfizer vaccine, which was granted full approval by the FDA, consists of genetic material called mRNA, which stimulates the immune system to protect against the virus. The vaccine material breaks down quickly after it’s absorbed into cells and it does not impact our genes. The Moderna vaccine, which also has full approval by the FDA, works in the same way.  The COVID-19 vaccines are new, but RNA vaccines have been around for the better part of the last decade. Experts have been researching this method to develop vaccines against other illnesses including influenza, Ebola and the Zika virus. Those years of scientific development helped researchers get to the point where we are today.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is different from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and only requires a single dose.   After a multi-step process to approve a vaccine, the FDA, along with the CDC, will continue to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines to rapidly detect safety problems if they exist.  “Any time a new vaccine is presented to the FDA, it’s tested and reviewed thoroughly before approval, even if it’s for emergency use,” said Thomas Balcezak, MD, chief medical officer for Yale New Haven Health.  In addition to the FDA’s review, Connecticut’s governor has a vaccine advisory committee to review the data. The group, which includes Richard Martinello, MD, Medical Director of Infection Prevention for Yale New Haven Health, recommended the immediate distribution of the vaccine.  What Are The Side Effects? Yale New Haven Health participated in the Pfizer vaccine trial, which included around 40,000 participants. During the course of that trial, no serious side effects were reported. Some mild side effects associated with the Pfizer vaccine can include a local reaction to the vaccination site, such as mild pain, redness or swelling. Similar side effects can occur with the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines as well.  Those mild reactions sometimes happen with other vaccines like the flu shot. To alleviate those minor symptoms, an ice pack can reduce soreness or swelling. A cool bath, drinking fluids and taking an over the counter pain reliever if approved by your doctor, could also be helpful.   Other side effects can include fever, chills, fatigue, headache, muscle pain and joint pain. Some people get side effects from vaccines because they “tickle” the immune system, provoking a response. That just means the vaccine is working, and it’s not a reason to be alarmed. Because there is no live or dead virus in the vaccine, you cannot get COVID-19 from it.  As with any vaccine, there is a very remote chance that it can cause a severe allergic reaction, serious injury or death. Any time someone experiences emergency symptoms, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, bluish lips or face, or any other sudden and severe symptom, they should call 9-1-1.  How Effective Is The Vaccine? The Pfizer vaccine is a 2-shot series. It is about 95% effective within one week of getting the second dose. It’s only around 53% effective after the first dose, which is why it’s important for all recipients to get the second dose. The Moderna vaccine has a similar efficacy, which is about the same as many common immunizations to protect against illnesses like polio and measles.  A third dose of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are recommended for those with certain immunocompromising conditions. A booster of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccine is available to adults 18 and older. A booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine is available for those 12 and older.  “This vaccine is safe and effective. The pandemic has taken a toll on everyone, but the availability of a vaccine with such an impressive efficacy is a testament to the researchers who have worked on this technology for years,” said Dr. Balcezak.  Johnson & Johnson found its vaccine was 72% effective in the U.S. and 66% effective overall in preventing severe cases, 28 days after vaccination.  Another COVID-19 vaccine by AstraZeneca is about 63% effective and uses a different technology than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The World Health Organization granted emergency authorization for this vaccine, but it has not yet been approved for emergency use by the FDA in the U.S.  So far, the FDA predicts the Pfizer vaccine will be effective for several months and possibly a year. In the meantime, experts will continue to study the virus and the vaccines developed to fight it.  There may be some scenarios where some people may need to consult with their doctor before getting the vaccine. For example, anyone who is currently sick with COVID-19 should wait before getting it.																
95	1	I open the email from a Facebook friend who recently told me they were against getting vaccinated for Covid-19, and scan it instead of reading it. It’s long and filled with rabbit-hole arguments and obscure links. Toward the end, it offensively compares vaccine cards with the yellow stars of the Holocaust. I take a breath and try to remember that perspective, that feeling of being so sure I was right and that almost all of modern science was wrong. I’m often angry at my friend and others like them who refuse to get vaccinated against Covid-19, but then I have to remind myself that I am no better than they are: For several years, I steadfastly refused all childhood vaccinations for my daughter, leaving her unprotected against a dozen or so highly contagious and potentially fatal diseases until second grade. The difference between me and the Covid-19 anti-vaxxers is that I was lucky enough to be an anti-vaxxer when there was no pandemic. If I keep that perspective in mind, then the quiet outreach I’ve been doing to nudge Covid anti-vaxxers to get the shot can feel like a small form of penance. I spend part of most days administering a large Facebook forum that facilitates peer-to-peer support for people with type 1 diabetes and their families. For the past two months, I’ve been regularly posting nudges on the forum to encourage people — especially those who are reluctant — to get the Covid-19 vaccine. These posts have been seen by tens of thousands of people. I also posted an open invitation to my Facebook friends to talk to me if they have concerns about the vaccine. My hope is to reach vaccine skeptics before their beliefs solidify, because it can be near impossible to reach them after that point, a lesson I know from hard experience.																
96	1	There have been literally over 100 million people that have been vaccinated at this point. So far, there's been a ridiculously low rate of serious side effects. Yes, it's not uncommon for people to have some fatigue or headache after getting the vaccinated, but those side effects are almost never serious enough to warrant hospitalization, and almost never last more than a day or two. On the other hand, a LOT of people have died from Covid. Over 600,000 in the US alone, with an even larger number of hospitalizations, and an even larger number of just people that were really sick for a few weeks. On top of that, there have been a ton of people that have had long-term health issues due to Covid, including breathing issues. So sure, it's technically a 'gamble' to get the vaccine, but it's a 'gamble' in the same way that walking across the street to a pharmacy to get a bandage for a bleeding wound is a 'gamble'. Sure, you miiiighhhtttt get hit by a car on your walk across the street, but it's so much more likely that you bleed out or the wound gets infected and that causes serious problems. And on top of all that, the vaccines also reduce the chance that you spread the virus, which not only protects other people from getting Covid, but also reduces the chances of a more deadly, more contagious, and/or more vaccine-resistant mutation of the virus that kicks off basically a whole new pandemic. And obviously none of us want that.																
97	1	The covid vaccine might have long term health issues. Covid 100% does. It can cause permanent neurological and lung damage. To maximize the chances of long term survival, taking the covid vaccine is the best option. Covid isn't going away any time soon, new variants emerge every few weeks. Even if you social distance, wear masks and everything else, you stand a pretty good chance of getting it.																
98	1	Let me preface this by me saying that I am definitely not a professional. For me, I’m going to try a different form of argument than I’m used to but I’ll mainly tell you my experience with the vaccine. I got the vaccine because while I do not entirely trust the vaccine earlier (with reasons similar to you such as how fast it was made), I think that if it lowers my chance and the chance of the people around me of getting ill and potentially passing away then I will get it. I would be heart broken if I knew that I was the cause of a loved one or dear friends’s death. I don’t want to feel that grief, so I will take a minor risk of being a guinea pig after MANY others have taken the vaccine before me with no major negative conditions.																
99	1	Requiring booster shots isn't abnormal; for example, MMR requires a booster, and of course the flu vaccine needs to be taken annually. Like the flu, COVID-19 keeps mutating, so there's that as well--makes life hard for vaccines. As far as I'm aware, there's no plausible mechanism for a vaccine--any vaccine--to cause long-term effects. All the components are gone from your body within, I've heard, weeks, so there's no way for it to do anything after that. Also, the very first trials started over a year ago, so we can be very confident that there's nothing that shows up within a year. And, after all that, there's the risk comparison. For whatever risks the vaccine may have, are they likely to be worse than COVID-19? I'm healthy and in my 20s, and COVID-19 (last July) had me crushingly lethargic and hanging out at the low 90s blood oxygen for ten days, after which it took about six months for my lungs to get back to normal. A good chunk of healthy young people would be even worse off, never mind if you have relevant risk factors.																
100	1	The vaccines approved in the US did not take any regulatory shortcuts. The reason they were approved fast is that in the face of a public health emergency, the FDA prioritized them over other work. Normally a lot of the time taken for a drug approval is just waiting for the FDA to actually look at it, because they're overworked. This was skipped. Since the vaccines have already passed the full FDA approvals process, there isn't another level of approval. Instead, there is post-approval monitoring, where adverse events related to the vaccines are reported back to the FDA. With over two hundred million does already given in the US, we now have one of the largest data sets of any drug. So there's nothing more going to happen that you can wait for.																
101	1	I’m vaccinated in just about every way a standard American citizen would be vaccinated, I get my flu shot every year. Part of me wanted to get the vaccine and be done with it. But part of me thinks, ‘This doesn’t sound like a flu shot.’																
102	1	Vaccination is the safest way to help you build protection against COVID-19. COVID-19 can have serious, life-threatening complications, and there is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you. And if you get sick – even if you have no symptoms – you could spread the disease to friends, family, and other vulnerable people around you. The COVID-19 vaccines that have been authorized/approved by the FDA and recommended by the CDC are safe and effective. Even though COVID-19 vaccines were developed more quickly than usual, vaccine safety was – and continues to be – a top priority in all phases of vaccine development (clinical trials), authorization/approval and post-authorization*/post-approval monitoring. While steps to develop the vaccines were streamlined or overlapped, none of them were skipped.																
103	1	The COVID-19 vaccination will help keep you from getting the virus. COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in clinical trials and have been approved because those studies show that the vaccine significantly reduces the probability of contracting the virus. Based on what has been proven about vaccines for other diseases, the COVID-19 vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill, even if you do get the virus. Getting vaccinated also may protect people around you – particularly those at greater risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Dr. Saag says the true value of the vaccine is more easily seen when we consider what would happen if the development of a vaccine had failed. We would be faced with an exploding pandemic for which there was no end in sight, Dr. Saag says. “It might continue to burn through the population for another two to four years. That’s what we were facing until we were rescued with a modern day miracle. The virus was sequenced in December of 2019, and that genetic sequence was available to the world on January 10 of 2020. After development and expanded clinical trials, we got a vaccine that works.” Dr. Saag compares the rapid development of a safe, highly effective vaccine to both a “home run” and an event that might be seen as divine intervention. “First, scientists developed the strategy and drug quickly,” Dr. Saag says. “Second, the resulting vaccine works at an almost unprecedented level of effectiveness. Third, the side-effect profile is the same as for most vaccines. You may get aches and fever that are gone in 36 hours, on average. So this is a walk-off, grand-slam home run in the last game of the World Series that you rarely witness in medicine. But I also call it a miracle drug, and it’s fitting that we began vaccinations during two religious holidays that celebrate miracles. If this pandemic were a classic Greek stage drama, the audience would see the vaccine as a deus ex machina, because the gods would have rescued us, the main character, from great danger.”																
104	1	COVID-19 vaccination is an important tool to help stop the pandemic. Stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools we have available. Wearing masks and social distancing help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others, but these measures are not enough. Vaccines work with your immune system, so it will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. The combination of getting vaccinated and following CDC recommendations to protect yourself and others provides the best protection from COVID-19. Ending the COVID-19 pandemic will halt the growing negative impact the virus is having on education, the economy, health care, and countless other activities of a functioning society. Dr. Saag notes that the public health benefit of the vaccine is the main reason for its use. “This is how we end the pandemic, full stop,” Dr. Saag says. “Once that is done, we can have a normal society again. We can enjoy daily life, family events, work, and school without distancing, without masks, and without fear. We will once again enjoy regular shopping trips and dining out and family vacations without constant worry about the consequences. We can have real holiday activities instead of virtual ones. It’s very simple: We will get our lives back.”																
105	1	“The Covid vaccine was the only logical choice after really re-evaluating what I believe in, what I actually believe is true,” Danielsen said. Danielsen partly credits her about-face to Lydia Greene and Heather Simpson, the founders of Back to the Vax, a support group for people like themselves: one-time vaccine skeptics who’d had a change of heart. “I want to be able to help stop people from going down that road, having been down it myself,” said Greene, now a nursing student.																
106	1	In our last article we discussed breakthrough infections, which occur when someone who has been vaccinated gets COVID-19. Breakthrough infections lead a lot of people to ask the question, why should I get vaccinated if I can still get COVID-19? The answer is because if you’re vaccinated you will not get as seriously sick and are less likely to die. In addition, you will help to stop this pandemic. The more people who are infected in a population the higher the prevalence level of the virus and increased risk for everyone. Unvaccinated individuals contribute to the number of people who can possibly get sick and provide a host for COVID-19 to replicate and create more variants. The more the virus spreads, the greater risk of mutation that could possibly be more dangerous than what we’ve seen so far. While vaccinated people can get COVID -19 and can spread it to others, you’re less likely to get COVID-19 if you’re vaccinated, and it spreads less easily in vaccinated people. This is also why it’s important to continue to follow the mandated health safety guidelines laid out by the CDC. Everyone wants to get back to regular life and avoid further isolation. The only way to do that is for the unvaccinated to get vaccinated and for the vaccinated to wear masks and take public health precautions. Typically, when people hear the words “public health” they think of somebody else’s health, but it is your health. COVID-19 is a public health issue. It’s similar to drinking and driving. When you drink and drive you are choosing to put other people’s safety at risk. Its why laws have been set in place to prevent this behavior. Not being vaccinated is choosing to put other people’s health at risk.																
107	0	As many and severe as “AEs”, adverse events, are to the bitterly opposed Pfizer/Moderna mRNA injections, many distinguished scientists and doctors fear that the worst is yet to come.  An Israeli Mathematician Says vaccination is causing a surge in youth deaths in Israel. A former top WHO scientist, Vice-President of the European Advisory Group to the World Health Organisation, Prof. Christian Perronne, says it is the vaccinated who are dangerous, and should be “isolated.”  And two UK funeral directors, who work with front-line health workers and see any unusual patterns in deaths, say vaccination campaigns have left unmistakable death and destruction in their wakes. One says that newborn child deaths are up higher than he has ever seen before, and that morgue coolers are “full of babies.” [1 , 2 ]  And yet, Fauci, media, and governments proceed to push the injections by citing the easily exposed lies, such as that “99.2% of COVID deaths are among the “unvaccinated.”  Below: ormer Vice-President of the European Advisory Group to the World Health Organisation, Prof. Christian Perronne, August 2021: “Unvaccinated people are not dangerous; vaccinated people are dangerous to others.

This is a result of the complete lack of long-term data on the safety of the injections, and the horrifying safety record so far, which, they all contend, should have halted the mass injections long ago.  The number of reported deaths is more than three times the number of deaths reported to he CDC for all other vaccines combined, since 1990  Possibly vaccine-caused deaths in the US reported to the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), are now over 18,000, with over 28,000 permanent disabilities. Though the links are not conclusive, in 1976 the Swine Flu vaccine program was halted after just 25 unexplained deaths, after being administered to 40 million Americans.

Shows lab evidence that Pfizer and Moderna mRNA spike protein injections may be quietly killing injection recipients through “micro-clots,” inflammation, and immune suppression.  Below: Dr. Ryan Cole (view at Bitchute)   Dr. Sherri Tenpenny is an American physician.   Dr. Judy Mikovits earned a PhD in biochemistry from George Washington University, and in 2006, she became the Research Director of the Whittemore Peterson Institute.  Tenpenny, Mikovits, and other doctors and scientists are warning of a coming mass casualty event, involving people who have received the experimental COVID vaccines, due to a reaction known as hyper-immune response.  Both the Pfizer and Moderna drugs are still in phase III human clinical trials, after skipping the normal three to six years of animal trials, until the end of 2022 at the earliest. Therefore, notwithstanding unprecedented FDA approval of a drug before clinical trials are complete, they are still experimental.  The average time for bringing any new drug or vaccine to general use is 10 years.   Hyper-immune response has been observed in test animals in prior attempts to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS.  The response may not take place until months after the injections, when subjects encounter the wild, mutated virus. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., founder of Children’s Health Defense, writes:  “Scientists first attempted to develop coronavirus vaccines after China’s 2002 SARS-CoV outbreak. Teams of US & foreign scientists vaccinated animals with the four most promising vaccines. At first, the experiment seemed successful as all the animals developed a robust antibody response to coronavirus. However, when the scientists exposed the vaccinated animals to the wild virus, the results were horrifying. Vaccinated animals suffered hyper-immune responses including inflammation throughout their bodies, especially in their lungs. Researchers had seen this same “enhanced immune response” during human testing of the failed RSV vaccine tests in the 1960s. Two children died.”  The UK Independent reported:   “COVID-19, like other coronaviruses, is expected to mutate at least every season, raising serious questions about claims that any vaccine will work. A successful vaccine has never been developed for any of the many strains of coronaviruses, due to the nature of the virus itself; and vaccinated people can have a higher chance of serious illness and death when later exposed to another strain of the virus, a phenomenon known as ‘virus interference.’ An earlier SARS vaccine never made it to market because the laboratory animals it was tested on contracted more serious symptoms on re-infection, and most of them died.”   One of the studies cited by scientists is “Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary immunopathology on challenge with the SARS virus.”   The mechanism which causes the deadly response upon much later exposure to the wild virus is called “pathogenic priming.”   Dr. James Lyons-Weiler, a Senior Research Scientist at the University of Pittsburgh, writes in a science paper on previous efforts to develop coronavirus vaccines:   “In SARS, a type of “priming” of the immune system was observed during animal studies of SARS spike protein-based vaccines leading to increased morbidity and mortality in vaccinated animals who were subsequently exposed to wild SARS virus. The problem, highlighted in two studies, became obvious following post-vaccination challenge with the SARS virus…”  The biotech industry newsletter Biopharma Dive writes:   “There has never been a vaccine for any coronavirus. And many vaccine developers have based their designs on previous research into other coronaviruses, like SARS or MERS, which share genetic similarities with SARS-CoV-2, but differences as well. Much still remains unknown about the novel coronavirus, and how our bodies respond to infection.”     Writing for Nature Magazine, Shibo Jiang, professor of virology at Fudan University, China, says:   “I have worked to develop vaccines and treatments for coronaviruses since 2003, when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak happened. In my view, standard protocols are essential for safeguarding health. Before allowing use of a COVID-19 vaccine in humans, regulators should evaluate safety with a range of virus strains and in more than one animal model…Work with the SARS virus shows that worrying immune responses were seen in ferrets and monkeys, but not in mice.”    Facebook Debunk of “False Information” Not Comforting, Zuckerberg Video Leaked Which Admits Concerns   If this article is posted on Facebook, it meets with an immediate “false information” notice, with a link to an explanation. The “fact-check” concludes “for the moment, the evidence has not shown the vaccines to have such an effect.” But this “fact check” itself is false, as shown by the large number of unexplained deaths, and testimony from pathologists such as Dr. Ryan Cole.

108	0	For the past two years, we were told that the answer to the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) plandemic, and the thing that would “save lives,” was everyone taking the Operation Warp Speed “vaccines.” It turns out, however, that population growth in the United States has reached an all-time low ever since the jabs were introduced.  In 2021, the year when most of the “fully vaccinated” got their jabs, the U.S. saw its population growth reach the lowest levels ever. This is according to the latest data from the Census Bureau.  The year prior, 2020, was not much better, as the population growth rate in America has been declining for some time. But things really ramped up in the depopulation department right after the “cure” for the Fauci Flu was introduced on a broad scale.  “U.S. growth didn’t slowly fade away: It slipped, and slipped, and then fell off a cliff,” wrote Derek Thompson for The Atlantic.  “The 2010s were already demographically stagnant; every year from 2011 to 2017, the U.S. grew by only 2 million people. In 2020, the U.S. grew by just 1.1 million. Last year, we added only 393,000 people … What’s going on?”  Thompson answers his own question in a roundabout way by pointing out that the vast majority of deaths in America occurred after the shots were released. He adds that they were particularly concentrated in 2021, which is when most people got jabbed.  “Last year, deaths exceeded births in a record-high number of U.S. counties,” Thompson further points out.  “Never before in American history have so many different parts of the country shrunk because of ‘natural decease,’ which is the difference between deaths and births.”  Rather than blame the jabs for declining population numbers, The Atlantic says there isn’t enough immigration Between 2019 and 2021, excess deaths accounted for 50 percent of the difference in population growth. Thompson blames the “pandemic” for this, but the reality is that a bulk of those deaths occurred after the jabs were introduced, and after they were plunged into people’s arms.  He stops short of linking the two things together, of course, but it is clear from his deduction as to the true cause of much of this death: the so-called “vaccines.” (Related: Covid vaccines have been linked to causing AIDS.)  Amazingly, Thompson goes into a lengthy diatribe blaming a lack of immigration in recent years on America’s declining population numbers. Back in 2016, he says, as many as one million new people from other countries legally immigrated to the U.S. Now, that figure is around 250,000 a year.  If true, this still does not explain the excess deaths that all occurred since the start of the plandemic when patients were being killed with respirators and remdesivir – this was pre-jab – as well as from late-2020 onward after the injections were widely administered.  Something clearly dramatic has happened ever since the Fauci Flu was foisted upon the world, but almost nobody is willing to identify the elephant in the room that caused it.  “These fake vaccines have the HIV genome embedded in the spike protein,” suggested someone at Natural News. “Fauci is a major shareholder in all of them. Major conflict of interest, along with being a mass murderer.”  “Vaccines are designed to prevent immunity, not bestow it,” wrote another. “This includes mRNA jabs. Vaccines do this by throwing the immune system off balance so that it attacks the body, thereby creating pharma clients for life.”  “When you are sick, or you have an injury or infection, your body temporarily produces antibodies to cope with the problem. Vaccines hijack this process and chronically hyper-stimulate the production of antibodies, causing severe inflammation. This is very harmful, and sometimes fatal.”

Why doe the CDC and government hide real Covid Vaccine death toll numbers and dangers from the public?  Big Pharma makes billions of dollars on selling medicine to people, whether they need it or not, and the covid “vaccine” is no different.  Perfectly healthy individuals are lining up for the covid “vaccine”; they’ve been scared into taking the death jab for fear of losing their jobs and lives.  This is all part of the Agenda.  Governments have been looking at Covid Vaccine passports, as you know. No one will be allowed to go anywhere unless proof of vaccination is provided; digital passport.  For some vaccinated people, the only place they’re traveling to is the grave.  The government continues to peddle the fraudulent, unproved claim that covid vaccines are safe and effective. Nothing could be further from the truth. According to the European Database of Adverse Drug Reactions for COVID-19 “Vaccines,” 3,964 people have died and 162,610 have been injured, and these are only the ones reported which are a very small percentage of the total.  Why are governments relentlessly pushing the covid “vaccine?” If you haven’t figured out by now, it’s all about money and control.  People lining up to get Covid Vaccines are listening to complete strangers (lying news media, Fauci, Bill Gates and government) to allow unknown chemicals to be injected into their bodies. This is not a vaccine, it’s a gene therapy, DNA-altering experiment on the public.  Covid was Never a killer virus; it was simply the flu, renamed; a scare tactic to enforce a vaccine that kills people.  Nurses Expose Empty Covid Wards. They Don’t Want To Be Part Of Fake News Anymore   Recently, people who have been vaccinated are sharing stories online about feeling lumps in their armpits, which might seem like cause for concern, but is in fact, to be expected. In a CDC report on the Moderna vaccine, the agency said that swelling of lymph nodes, also known as lymphadenopathy, can occur in either the arm or the neck, and is normal.  The CDC says swelling of lymph nodes in the neck and armpit is a normal side effect for the covid shot?  There are many reports from people saying the covid vaccine is linked to deaths that occurred after covid shots were administered, leading many to wonder whether inoculation is safe.   covid shot side effects include rash, lumps, blood clots, heart attack and death. There are many reports from people saying the covid vaccine is linked to deaths that occurred after covid shots were administered, leading many to wonder whether inoculation is safe. Covid shot side effects also include rash and lumps In January, 2021, Dr. Gregory Michael, a Florida obstetrician and gynecologist, died 16 days after receiving Pfizer’s covid vaccine.  The 56-year-old doctor developed acute immune thrombocytopenia — a disorder that prevents the blood from clotting properly.   “He was vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine at MSMC on December 18, 2020. Three days later, Dr. Gregory Michael saw a strong set of petechiae on his feet and hands, which made him seek attention at the emergency room at MSMC,” Heidi Neckelmann, Michael’s wife said.   “The CBC that was done at his arrival showed his platelet count to be 0 (normal platelet counts range from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood.) Dr. Gregory Michael was admitted in the ICU with a diagnosis of acute ITP caused by a reaction to the COVID vaccine,” she continued.   Many people who died after receiving the Covid “vaccine” had a platelet count of 150 or below – this is critical.  People WILL NOT take the “vaccine”   What some doctors say about Covid Vaccine Side Effects  Dr. Gregory Michael’s death spurred fears that the vaccine may be directly related to the doctor’s death. However, scientists warned that his death is an isolated case and said the vaccine is not related (lies to protect Big Pharma profits.)   “These vaccines have had incredible safety profiles in the trials and post-authorization. So far, there has been nothing to confirm these awful events,” Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital, said (there were no trials or tests; they are testing on people.)  “There are going to be spurious relationships, especially as the vaccine is targeting elderly or those with chronic conditions. Just because these events happen in proximity to the vaccine does not mean the vaccine caused these events,” he added (more lies…you will see the truth below.)  side effects of covid shot.

110	0	A stunning new report claims that COVID-19 vaccines are causing a lot more harm and many more deaths than previously known, and could eventually be responsible for “hundreds of thousands more dead.”  “The number of Americans who have suffered serious side effects or died after receiving the mRNA injection billed as a ‘vaccine’ is exploding,” the RAIR Foundation’s Amy Mek reported last week.  “Furthermore, injected people seem to be much worse off than those who refuse the experimental jab. Yet, despite the ‘vaccine’ and ‘boosters’ not protecting people from COVID, and increasing the chances of infection from Omicron, left-wing governments worldwide continue to pressure and mandate citizens to receive them,” she continued.  Mek cited a report from the One America News Network, which reported last month that as of 4 January, at least 946,000 Americans had died after taking the vaccine or had experienced serious side effects. Also, the report noted that the Department of Health and Human Services has noted that more than 100,000 Americans have had to be hospitalized after taking the jab.  “Those suffering from the injection’s side effects are not just nameless figures on a page, reports OAN. For example, Angelia Desselle from Louisiana could barely stand after her shot and suffers from a neurological disorder that, according to doctors, is the result of the vaccine. Likewise, Shawn Skelton from Indiana has been debilitated and lost control of her body since the Pfizer shot,” Mek reported.  And fully-vaccinated Jummai Nache of Minnesota underwent amputation of her legs and hands after she was vaccinated, while 13-year-old Maddie de Garay from Ohio has been paralyzed from the waist down, must now be fed through a tube, and has “lost complete control of her bodily functions,” Mek noted.  Health officials in the communist country of Vietnam have more respect for their people than Western officials do; that country suspended the use of the Pfizer vaccine after more than 120 children had an adverse reaction and needed to be hospitalized. Three children died, in fact.  According to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been more than 20,000 deaths after COVID-19 vaccines — which may not seem like a lot unless, of course, unless one of those deaths was someone close to you.  But that said, researchers from Columbia University report that the actual number of people who have died after getting a COVID vaccine is actually much higher than the official numbers say. Data scientists at the institution say that the government is underreporting vaccine deaths by a factor of 20, meaning there are actually around 400,000 COVID vaccine deaths.  Finally,  former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, who has been following the pandemic and emerging research for nearly two years, is reporting that mRNA shots are now showing a strong negative efficacy and could actually be increasing a person’s chance of contracting the omicron variant.  Mek adds:  According to OAN, tens of thousands of people, including children, have also died following the vaccination. Thirteen-year-old Jacob Clynick of Michigan died in his sleep shortly after getting his second Pfizer shot. An 11-year-old girl from Georgia died shortly after her Pfizer vaccine. Also, a 5-year-old girl died four days after getting her first Pfizer shot. In addition, an 8-year-old girl suffered a stroke and a brain hemorrhage seven days after the Pfizer shot.  “We are now seeing the ramifications of this untested, unproven, and hastily developed vaccine, and it is much worse than we feared,” said OAN’s Pearson Sharp, “and this is just the beginning.”  “Unless Americans and parents stand up to these unscientific mandates, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands more dead and permanently injured victims from the biggest experiment on human beings in history,” Sharp continued.																
111	0	Healthy teenagers, athletes and doctors are among the tens of thousands of people who died within hours or days after getting their Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine doses. And an increasing number felt the need to speak out about the ways the COVID-19 injections have altered their lives.  Long-term effects of COVID-19 shots are not yet clear, although spike proteins are said to circulate in the body after injections, causing damage to cells, tissues and organs. Dr. Peter McCullough, an internist, cardiologist and trained epidemiologist known for voicing out against the vaccines said spike proteins are deadly.  Experimental and observational evidence showed that the human immune response to the shots is very different compared to the response induced by exposure to the virus. Some believe that the COVID-19 shots may actually damage the innate immune systems of humans, leading to a form of vaccine-induced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or VAIDS. (Related: THE KILLING FIELDS: Dozens of athletes now confirmed to have dropped dead from covid “vaccines.”)  Moreover, due to the monocyte activation by the spike protein from the vaccine, there are those who experienced a range of debilitating symptoms after receiving a dose of the vaccine, similar to those found in long-haul COVID-19 syndrome, including headaches, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and joint and chest pain.  Others believe the adverse effects occur quickly, resulting in life-changing debilitation.  COVID-19 vaccines affect healthy people Among the most surprising effects of the vaccines is how they have been affecting otherwise healthy people. Athletes around the world have died of heart attacks and strokes following their shots.  Marathon champion Alexaida Guedez of Venezuela died of a heart attack during a 5,000-meter race on August 22, 2021. Abou Ali, a 22-year-old soccer player suffered from cardiac arrest in Denmark on September 11, 2021. Andrea Astolfi, a 45-year-old sports director of Calcio Orsago in Italy, died of a heart attack on the same day as Ali, after returning from training. Caddy Alberto Olguin collapsed and died from a heart attack on the golf course nearly a month later. Another soccer player, 14-year-old Ava Azzopardi, collapsed on a soccer field in the U.S. on October 15, 2021, following a cardiac arrest. She had to be put in a medically induced coma to survive.  Dr. Neil Singh Dhalla, an ophthalmologist, died from a heart attack four days after he got his COVID-19 booster shot. His autopsy also showed myocarditis – an inflammation of the heart muscle that is considered to be an adverse effect of the mRNA COVID-19 shots. (Related: According to the discredited vaccine industry, sports referee WHISTLES the cause behind heart problems in perfectly healthy athletes.)  An unnamed vaccine advocate who took a Pfizer shot said he started having blurry vision in his left eye after his shot, and lost 60 percent of his vision within three days. After a slew of medical examinations, he was diagnosed with central serous retinopathy, where a small vein rupture led to fluid accumulation under the retina and caused partial blindness.  Long-term effects of COVID-19 vaccines More than the already apparent short-term adverse effects of the vaccines that have been reported through clinical trial reports and personal experiences, there’s little that is known about the possible long-term effects of the COVID-19 shots. Scientists have studied available evidence and the rules of science have not allowed scientists to say that long-term effects can never happen.  The history of vaccines shows that there are severe effects that can follow vaccination, and they tend to happen within two months of vaccinations.  For COVID-19 vaccines, there had been some severe side effects that occurred shortly after vaccination, including thrombosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myocarditis and pericarditis. These usually happen within a few days after receiving the vaccine, leading many to wonder what might happen months or years down the line.

112	0	The CDC has become a “purely political organization,” says Dr. Robert Malone, one of the creators of mRNA injections, as they are the ones spreading medical misinformation and hiding critical data from physicians, scientists, health authorities and the American public. This misinformation constitutes fraud and is criminal. Also, according to Dr. Robert Malone, regarding the CDC government employees hiding crucial data that reveals what he and other prominent doctors have been exposing for two years now, “There are going to be legal consequences, and I believe they have a choice. These government employees have been participating in hiding this data. They can either be defendants or they can be witnesses.”  Today, we have reached a point where many Americans serving leadership roles in different realms appear guilty of medical fascism and promoting deadly, blood-clotting, gene therapy injections that are responsible for countless grave injuries and thousands (if not millions) of deaths of American citizens.  Nuremberg-style murder trials may be coming for the scientists, government employees, media journo-terrorists who have knowingly pushed deadly Covid jab propaganda After World War II, the Allies held the Nuremberg trials for the leadership of Nazi Germany, which included surviving members from different areas, including political, military, judicial, science, medical and economic. Hitler’s army of yes-men were guilty of mass murder and participating in genocidal warfare, and were tried as such. Just because they were “taking orders” from higher-ups did not make them innocent of these horrific crimes.  The same could be said today about certain government officials at regulatory agencies, in all branches of government, journalists, scientists, physicians and even the billionaires funding and pushing “vaccine” propaganda that’s responsible for millions of deaths across the globe, not just in the United States.  During the Nazi regime’s attempted takeover of the world, very few people knew what was REALLY going on in the concentration camps. Hitler was using medical experiments and deadly gas to exterminate millions of innocent people he deemed were a burden on society and the economy. It was eugenics. It was mass murder. It was genocide. And it was all done under a canopy of greed, lust for power and psychotic plans to reduce the population of the world dramatically. However, many of the people near the top knew what was going on, and they went along with it anyway, disregarding the consequences they would face later when put on trial for mass murder.  Today, most people have no clue that the Covid “vaccines” are the new population reduction mechanism, changing the genes of humans to create toxic prions and nanobots in the blood that are already wiping out humans who are a “drain” on the system–those who are already suffering from chronic diseases and disorders, like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, obesity and dementia.  It’s just a matter of time before enough humans die from the Covid jabs and the guilty perpetrators are indicted for their crimes According to the “Corona Investigative Committee,” there is already compelling evidence that the so-called “vaccines” for Covid are designed to intentionally kill people. This would constitute premeditative murder, and lawyers in India have already filed complaints in this regard. Even perfectly healthy people are already suffering from the deadly effects, labeled “side effects,” of the Fauci Flu jabs, including blood clots, myocarditis and severe neurological disorders. This is just the beginning, and that’s why it’s so hard for the general populace to “see the forest for the trees.”  The CDC is lying. The FDA is lying. The scientists who created these deadly vaccines are lying. There are even key whistleblowers from the “inside” already who helped create the eugenics injections (mRNA), like Dr. Robert Malone, trying to warn the world of this mass population reduction scheme.  The Covid-19 vaccines are not “safe and effective,” in fact, they’re just the opposite, dangerous and deadly. They are mass experiments that contain lethal doses of poison. Just because they don’t kill people instantly, like the gas chambers of WWII, doesn’t mean they’re not deadly weapons of mass destruction.  Now, it’s coming out that death statistics from the “vaccines” can be traced back to specific batches, as some are more lethal than others. Even airline pilots, elite athletes and military members are dropping like flies after getting the prion injections from Pfizer, Moderna and J&J. The next round of “Nuremberg” trials are coming soon for the people who are pushing these shots (pardon the pun). The only question is what legal structure will be used for the upcoming court hearings, and what media platforms will show the world what’s happening?

113	0	Leaked top-secret Pfizer document shows COVID-19 vaccine is FAR MORE DANGEROUS than the world knows 03/03/2022 / By Arsenio Toledo / Comments Bypass censorship by sharing this link: New  https://citizens.news/598812.html Copy URL Leaked top-secret Pfizer document shows COVID-19 vaccine is FAR MORE DANGEROUS than the world knows  A top-secret document from Big Pharma company Pfizer is currently circulating online. This document proves that Pfizer’s Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is causing deadly adverse effects and is killing so many of the fully vaccinated.  “Now we know why they were censoring everyone and why they were killing doctors. They didn’t want people to know what this vaccine actually does,” commented Ron Johnson of the show “Stranger Than Fiction News.”  Pfizer and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently lost a bid to prevent the quick release of hundreds of thousands of pages worth of documents containing information regarding the Big Pharma company’s vaccine.  The FDA wanted to release 500 pages a month. But a federal judge in Texas instead ordered the publication of at least 55,000 pages a month. The court said it is “of paramount public importance” that the information is released as quickly as possible.  Aaron Siri, the lawyer who represented Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency (PHMPT) in its lawsuit against the FDA’s withholding of important documents, said the decision “came down on the side of transparency and accountability.”  The PHMPT believes the FDA is withholding an estimated 450,000 pages worth of information regarding Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. (Related: Pfizer panicking after judge orders accelerated release of COVID vaccine documents amid fears “business will be harmed.”)  Leaked document contains details of Pfizer vaccine adverse events The FDA started releasing Pfizer documents on March 1. One of the documents that went public is titled “5.3.6 Cumulative Analysis of Post-Authorization Adverse Event Reports of PF-07302048 (BNT162B2) Received Through 28-Feb-2021.”  Brighteon.TV This 38-page document goes into detail regarding how many people have suffered adverse events and what kind of side effects they have experienced after getting Pfizer’s vaccine. It is uncertain whether this document is part of the FDA’s court-mandated release of information or whether hackers or whistleblowers leaked this document to the internet.  The document’s appendix is nine pages long and it lists all recorded adverse events associated with Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine.  The very first adverse event Pfizer admitted that was associated with the COVID-19 vaccine is 1p36 deletion syndrome. This is a congenital genetic disorder that affects fetuses and deletes part of their chromosomes, causing them to be born with severe intellectual disabilities.  Most affected individuals will have speech difficulties or will be unable to speak entirely. Children affected by this syndrome will also have structural abnormalities in their brains, have weak muscle tones and difficulty swallowing and more than half of them will have seizures.  This confirms what other researchers have known all along: that the unborn children of pregnant women who get vaccinated are severely affected by the experimental and deadly vaccine.  Johnson noted with shock how many different kinds of herpes Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine could give people.  “Herpes sepsis, herpes simplex, herpes simplex cervicitis – for women out there that got this vaccine – and the list just goes on and on,” said Johnson. “What else we got? Herpes zoster, herpes infection … herpes [simplex] meningitis.”  Document conveniently leaked while world was distracted “This document is proprietary and confidential. Confidential, right there,” said Johnson, referring to the first page of the document that warns against the disclosure, reproduction or distribution of the document without the authorization of Pfizer or other regulatory agencies. “They didn’t want people to see this. This is why they wanted people to wait like 75 years to see what’s in it.”  “This vaccine is worse than the disease,” said Johnson. “Everyone in the world rolled out this gene-altering vaccine with nano lipids that essentially carpet-bombed the internal organs of all those who received this vaccine, including children.”  “Isn’t that the worst of it? All the way down to five-year-olds, and they really wanted to get the newborns. They wanted to kill everyone.”  Johnson noted how convenient it was that this document was leaked at the same time the world was focused on other matters, including fighting lockdowns and mask and vaccine mandates and the war in Ukraine.  “They wanted people to forget about this,” he said. “They wanted people thinking about mushroom clouds and World War III – anything but the vaccines, anything but the plandemic.”  More related stories: To expand profits, Pfizer reportedly partnered with CCP-linked pharmaceutical company that engaged in “military combat” with China’s People’s Liberation Army.  Pfizer manipulated legal immunity for itself against covid “vaccine” adverse effects caused by negligence, fraud or malice.  Pfizer admits in confidential document that COVID-19 vaccine causes Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease (same thing as Antibody Dependent Enhancement).  Pfizer has effectively dominated the COVID-19 vaccine market in Europe, raking in billions of dollars in the process.  Criminal conspiracy unraveling: Pfizer and the government concealed thousands of deaths, mass injuries caused by experimental covid jabs.

114	0	The following EXTREMELY IMPORTANT article is reproduced from LifeSiteNews.com. The claims made by Dr Yeadon are diametrically opposite to those of Dr Vanden Bossche in regards to the matter of immune escape. Nevertheless both warn against the crazy mass vaccination program for COVID-19. Here Dr Yeadon warns that our governments are lying to us. There is no need for any vaccine for the fake COVID pandemic.   Dr Michael Yeadon April 7, 2021 (LifeSiteNews) — Dr. Michael Yeadon, Pfizer’s former Vice President and Chief Scientist for Allergy & Respiratory who spent 32 years in the industry leading new medicines research and retired from the pharmaceutical giant with “the most senior research position” in his field, spoke with LifeSiteNews in a telephone interview.   He addressed the “demonstrably false” propaganda from governments in response to COVID-19, including the “lie” of dangerous variants, the totalitarian potential for “vaccine passports,” and the strong possibility we are dealing with a “conspiracy” which could lead to something far beyond the carnage experienced in the wars and massacres of the 20th century.  His main points included:  There is “no possibility” current variants of COVID-19 will escape immunity. It is “just a lie.” Yet, governments around the world are repeating this lie, indicating that we are witnessing not just “convergent opportunism,” but a “conspiracy.” Meanwhile media outlets and Big Tech platforms are committed to the same propaganda and the censorship of the truth. Pharmaceutical companies have already begun to develop unneeded “top-up” (“booster”) vaccines for the “variants.” The companies are planning to manufacture billions of vials, in addition to the current experimental COVID-19 “vaccine” campaign.  Regulatory agencies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, have announced that since these “top-up” vaccines will be so similar to the prior injections which were approved for emergency use authorization, drug companies will not be required to “perform any clinical safety studies.” Thus, this virtually means that design and implementation of repeated and coerced mRNA vaccines “go from the computer screen of a pharmaceutical company into the arms of hundreds of millions of people, [injecting] some superfluous genetic sequence for which there is absolutely no need or justification.” Why are they doing this? Since no benign reason is apparent, the use of vaccine passports along with a “banking reset” could issue in a totalitarianism unlike the world has ever seen. Recalling the evil of Stalin, Mao, and Hitler, “mass depopulation” remains a logical outcome. The fact that this at least could be true means everyone must “fight like crazy to make sure that system never forms.”  Dr. Yeadon began identifying himself as merely a “boring guy” who went “to work for a big drug company … listening to the main national broadcast and reading the broad sheet newspapers.”  Continuing, he said: “But in the last year I have realized that my government and its advisers are lying in the faces of the British people about everything to do with this coronavirus. Absolutely everything. It’s a fallacy this idea of asymptomatic transmission and that you don’t have symptoms, but you are a source of a virus. That lockdowns work, that masks have a protective value obviously for you or someone else, and that variants are scary things and we even need to close international borders in case some of these nasty foreign variants get in.   “Or, by the way, on top of the current list of gene-based vaccines that we have miraculously made, there will be some ‘top-up’ vaccines to cope with the immune escape variants.   “Everything I have told you, every single one of those things is demonstrably false. But our entire national policy is based on these all being broadly right, but they are all wrong.”  ‘Conspiracy’ and not just ‘convergent opportunism’ “But what I would like to do is talk about immune escape because I think that’s probably going to be the end game for this whole event, which I think is probably a conspiracy. Last year I thought it was what I called ‘convergent opportunism,’ that is a bunch of different stakeholder groups have managed to pounce on a world in chaos to push us in a particular direction. So it looked like it was kind of linked, but I was prepared to say it was just convergence.”  “I [now] think that’s naïve. There is no question in my mind that very significant powerbrokers around the world have either planned to take advantage of the next pandemic or created the pandemic. One of those two things is true because the reason it must be true is that dozens and dozens of governments are all saying the same lies and doing the same inefficacious things that demonstrably cost lives.   “And they are talking the same sort of future script which is, ‘We don’t want you to move around because of these pesky varmints, these “variants”’— which I call ‘samiants’ by the way, because they are pretty much the same — but they’re all saying this and they are all saying ‘don’t worry, there will be “top-up” vaccines that will cope with the potential escapees.’ They’re all saying this when it is obviously nonsense.”  Possible end game: vaccine ‘passports’ tied to spending allowances, thorough control “I think the end game is going to be, ‘everyone receives a vaccine’… Everyone on the planet is going to find themselves persuaded, cajoled, not quite mandated, hemmed-in to take a jab.   “When they do that every single individual on the planet will have a name, or unique digital ID and a health status flag which will be ‘vaccinated,’ or not … and whoever possesses that, sort of single database, operable centrally, applicable everywhere to control, to provide as it were, a privilege, you can either cross this particular threshold or conduct this particular transaction or not depending on [what] the controllers of that one human population database decide. And I think that’s what this is all about because once you’ve got that, we become playthings and the world can be as the controllers of that database want it.   “For example, you might find that after a banking reset that you can only spend through using an app that actually feeds off this [database], your ID, your name, [and] your health status flag.”  “And, yes, certainly crossing an international border is the most obvious use for these vaccine passports, as they are called, but I’ve heard talk of them already that they could be necessary for you to get into public spaces, enclosed public spaces. I expect that if they wanted to, you would not be able to leave your house in the future without the appropriate privilege on your app.  “But even if that’s not [the] true [intent of the vaccine campaign], it doesn’t matter, the fact that it could be true means everyone [reading] this should fight like crazy to make sure that [vaccine passport] system never forms.”  “[With such a system], here is an example of what they could make you do, and I think this is what they’re going to make [people] do.  “You could invent a story that is about a virus and its variations, its mutations over time. You could invent the story and make sure you embed it through the captive media, make sure that no one can counter it by censoring alternative sources, then people are now familiar with this idea that this virus mutates, which it does, and that it produces variants, which is true [as well], which could escape your immune system, and that’s a lie.   “But, nevertheless, we’re going to tell you it’s true, and then when we tell you that it’s true and we say ‘but we’ve got the cure, here’s a top-up vaccine,’ you’ll get a message, based on this one global, this one ID system: ‘Bing!’ it will come up and say ‘Dr. Yeadon, time for your top-up vaccine. And, by the way,’ it will say ‘your existing immune privileges remain valid for four weeks. But if you don’t get your top-up vaccine in that time, you will unfortunately detrimentally be an “out person,” and you don’t want that, do you?’ So, that’s how it’ll work, and people will just walk up and they’ll get their top-up vaccine.”  Gov’t lies, Big Pharma moves forward, medicine regulators get out of the way, and possible ‘mass-depopulation’ “But I will take you through this, Patrick, because I am qualified to comment. I don’t know what Vanden Bossche is about. There was no possibility at all, based on all of the variants that are in the public domain, 4000 or so of them, none of them are going to escape immunity [i.e. become more dangerous].  “Nevertheless, politicians and health advisers (to loads of governments) are saying that they are. They’re lying. Well, why would you do that?   “Here’s the other thing, in parallel, pharmaceutical companies have said, several of them, it will be quite easy for us to adjust our gene-based vaccines, and we can hasten them through development, and we can help you.   “And here’s the real scary part, global medicines regulators like [the U.S. Food and Drug Administration] FDA, the Japanese medicines agency, the European Medicines Agency, have gotten together and announced … since top-up vaccines will be considered so similar to the ones that we have already approved for emergency use authorization, we are not going to require the drug companies to perform any clinical safety studies.   “So, you’ve got on the one hand, governments and their advisers that are lying to you that variants are different enough from the current virus that, even if you’re immune from natural exposure or vaccination, you’re a risk and you need to come and get this top-up vaccine. So, I think neither of those are true. So why is the drug company making the top-up vaccines? And [with] the regulators having got out of the way — and if Yeadon is right, and I’m sure I am or I wouldn’t be telling you this — you go from the computer screen of a pharmaceutical company into the arms of hundreds of millions of people, some superfluous genetic sequence for which there is absolutely no need or justification.   “And if you wanted to introduce a characteristic which could be harmful and could even be lethal, and you can even tune it to say ‘let’s put it in some gene that will cause liver injury over a nine-month period,’ or, cause your kidneys to fail but not until you encounter this kind of organism [that would be quite possible]. Biotechnology provides you with limitless ways, frankly, to injure or kill billions of people.   “And since I can’t think of a benign explanation for any of the steps: variants, top-up vaccines, no regulatory studies… it’s not only that I cannot think of a benign explanation, the steps described, and the scenario described, and the necessary sort of resolution to this false problem is going to allow what I just described: unknown, and unnecessary gene sequences injected into the arms of potentially billions of people for no reason.   “I’m very worried … that pathway will be used for mass depopulation, because I can’t think of any benign explanation.”  ‘Absurdly impossible’ variants will escape immunity, ‘just a lie’ “If I can show you that one major thing that governments around the world are telling the people is a lie, you should take my 32 years of experienced opinion that says, most of it, if not all of it, is a lie.”  “The most different variant is only 0.3% different from the original sequence as emailed out of Wuhan in … January 2020. 0.3% [is] the one [variant] that is the most different on the planet so far. And now another way of saying it is, ‘all of the variants are not less than 99.7% identical to each other.’   “Now, you might be thinking, ‘hmm, .3%, is that enough [to escape immunity and become more dangerous]?’ The answer is no. Get away, ya know, get out of here …   “The human immune system is a thing of wonder. What it does is when it faces a new pathogen like this, you’ve got professional cells, they’re called professional antigen-presenting cells —they’re kind of rough tough things that tend not to succumb to viruses. And their job is to grab foreign things in the near environment and tear them limb from limb [inside the cell]. They really cut them up into hundreds of pieces. And then they present these pieces on the surfaces of their cell to other bits of your immune system, and amazingly, because of the variability that God and nature gave you, huge variability to recognize foreign things, and your body ends up using 15 to 20 different specific motifs that it spots about this virus. They’re called epitopes, basically they’re just like little photographs of the details about this virus. That’s what they do. And that is what is called your repertoire, your immune repertoire is like 20 different accurate photographs, close-ups, of different bits of this virus.  “Now, if a tiny piece of the virus changes, like the .3% I’ve just described, if you are reinfected by that variant, your professional cells tear into that virus and cut it into pieces, present them again, and lo and behold, most of the pieces that you have already seen and recognized, are still there in the variants.  “There is absolutely no chance that all of them will fail to be recognized and that is what is required for immune escape, to escape your immunity. It must present to you as a new pathogen. It must be sufficiently different that, when it is cut up by your professional checker cells, it won’t find mostly the same thing it has seen before. And that is just absurdly impossible when you have only varied .3%, so it is 99.7% (similar).  “You can go and check that by looking at papers by a person called Alison Tarke. There is also Shane Crotty, and all of the other co-authors.  “And before them, coming from my theoretical understanding of multi-locus immunity, which is what I just badly tried to describe, to what actually happens … If your [immune system] is presented with something that contains even half of those similar pieces, there is no way your body will say, ‘that’s a new pathogen.’   “And, so, the idea that 0.3% could even have a chance of getting around immunity is just a lie. It’s not [even] like an opinion difference.   “I don’t think 3% would be enough. That’s 10 times more variation than has occurred in 16 months [with this virus]. I don’t even think 30% difference would be enough. So, I’m saying that 100 times more variation than has actually happened, would still leave me putting a big bet on the human immune system not being fooled that these are new pathogens.   “I’ve chatted this over with several professors of immunology and they agreed with me, it’s like, ‘why are you asking me this?’  “So, I think that what I’ve just said is that governments and their advisors in multiple countries are lying about variants. That’s a massive thing! You should check it out. Your readers should check it out. If it’s true, don’t you think it’s terrifying?! It was when I realized it.   “So, they’re lying about variants, and then, of course, since [the variants] are not really different, you do not need a ‘top-up’ vaccine. Now you should be getting the hairs on the back of your neck up, because they are making them right now!”   “They are making billions of vials of it. And they will be available by the end of the year.  “And I think they’ll require people to first, be on the vaccine passport one-world database, and then it will roll up into the top-ups, and if it takes a bit longer it will take a bit longer.   “But this is not going away. It won’t go away until enough people, if they ever do, say ‘you’re a bunch of frauds and we are taking our freedoms back, so you can just stop doing this.’   “Because one person shouting into the wilderness and all of the other academics looking the other way, will have us just going down this pipe maybe a week later than if I hadn’t said anything, but we’re still going down to hell.   “So, that’s why I’m frightened.   “The variants aren’t different. I call them ‘samiants’… they’re pretty much the same. They’re not different. Therefore, you don’t need a top-up vaccine, so don’t go near any of them.”  ‘Why is my government lying to me?’ Because ‘they are going to kill you.’ “[And if you recognize that our governments are involved in a major verifiable lie], don’t just turn your computer off and go to supper. Stop. Look out the window, and think, ‘why is my government lying to me about something so fundamental?’ Because, I think the answer is, they are going to kill you using this method. They’re going to kill you and your family.   “The eugenicists have got hold of the levers of power and this is a really artful way of getting you to line-up and receive some unspecified thing that will damage you. I have no idea what it will actually be, but it won’t be a vaccine because you don’t need one. And it won’t kill you on the end of the needle because you would spot that.  “It could be something that will produce normal pathology, it will be at various times between vaccination and the event, it will be plausibly deniable because there will be something else going on in the world at that time, in the context of which your demise, or that of your children will look normal.   “That’s what I would do if I wanted to get rid of 90 or 95% of the world’s population. And I think that’s what they’re doing.”  “Now I don’t know [for certain] that they’re going to use that [system] to kill you, but I can’t think of a benign reason, and with that power they certainly could harm you, or control you, so you should object [and strenuously oppose it].”  People can’t deal with this level of evil, but Soviets, Hitler, Mao show its possibility “It’s become absolutely clear to me, even when I talk to intelligent people, friends, acquaintances … and they can tell I’m telling them something important, but they get to the point [where I say] ‘your government is lying to you in a way that could lead to your death and that of your children,’ and they can’t begin to engage with it. And I think maybe 10% of them understand what I said, and 90% of those blank their understanding of it because it is too difficult. And my concern is, we are going to lose this, because people will not deal with the possibility that anyone is so evil…  “But I remind you of what happened in Russia in the 20th Century, what happened in 1933 to 1945, what happened in, you know, Southeast Asia in some of the most awful times in the post-war era. And, what happened in China with Mao and so on.  “We’ve only got to look back two or three generations. All around us there are people who are as bad as the people doing this. They’re all around us. So, I say to folks, the only thing that really marks this one out, is its scale.   “But actually, this is probably less bloody, it’s less personal, isn’t it? The people who are steering this … it’s going to be much easier for them. They don’t have to shoot anyone in the face. They don’t have to beat someone to death with a baseball bat, or freeze them, starve them, make them work until they die. All of those things did happen two or three generations back and our grandparents or great grandparents were either victims of this, or they were actually members of it, or at least they witnessed it from overseas. That’s how close we are.  “And all I’m saying is, some shifts like that are happening again, but now they are using molecular biology.  “And the people going along with it, I think they would probably say, ‘I was only following orders,’ which we have heard before.   “But I know, because I have talked to lots of people, and some of them have said ‘I don’t want to believe that you are right, so I’m going to just put it away because if it is true, I can’t handle it.’ And I think … all you need to do is find a good reason to tell people, ‘Don’t take the vaccine unless you’re a medical risk of dying from the virus!’ That seems to me a pretty good line!”  Towards a solution – ‘We need God’ “I’m a scientist, and I can tell you, talking to non-scientists, using science as a tool, will not work. It will fail.   “So, we need philosophers, people who understand logic, religion, something like that, [they have] got to wrestle with this, and start talking in a language people will understand. Because if we leave it with scientists, people like me, even though I’m well-intentioned, I’m a gabbling alien as far as most people in the street are concerned. They won’t believe the government will lie to them, they don’t believe the government would ever do anything that will harm them, but they are [doing such things].”  Finally, in an email correspondence, Dr. Yeadon concluded, “I have latest taken to signing off with ‘May God save us’, because I think we need God now more than at any time since WW2.”																
115	0	An Israeli organization made up of health experts has published a report outlining how the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) injection from Pfizer causes damage to nearly every system in the human body.  The Israeli People Committee (IPC) says that Pfizer’s Chinese Virus jab is causing catastrophic damage to people’s bodies – so much so, in fact, that there are more people dying from it in Israel than there are people in all of Europe who are dying from the AstraZeneca jab.  You know things are bad when the bar has been so lowered that it is now considered a privilege to have a jab that causes just a wee-bit fewer deaths than the one your own government is mandating.  According to IPC, “there has never been a vaccine that has harmed as many people” as the Pfizer vaccine has. The group published a full report detailing its eye-opening findings.  “We received 288 death reports in proximity to vaccination (90% up to 10 days after the vaccination),” one part of the report explains. “64% of those were men.”   Meanwhile, Israel’s official Ministry of Health is claiming that “only 45 deaths in Israel were vaccine related.”  Assuming these figures are accurate, the Israeli government is blatantly lying about the number of Israelis who are being injured or killed by the Pfizer injection, which appears to be the jab of choice for the Israeli people.  All Covid-19 injections are dangerous and deadly All of this is even more concerning when considering the fact that the only jabs governments around the world have been focusing on as dangerous are the ones from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson (J&J).  Both of these just so happen to be the only two that are not loaded with DNA-reprogramming mRNA chemicals. The J&J and AstraZeneca injections are considered to be more “traditional” in terms of the technology used.  Meanwhile, Pfizer’s jab is killing people left and right in Israel, and Moderna’s is not much better, and we have not heard so much as a peep from the government about “pausing” either of those.  In Europe, where AstraZeneca’s injection is being widely used, numerous countries have suspended its use entirely, citing a pandemic of deadly blood clots and other adverse effects.  German scientists recently discovered the two-step process by which AstraZeneca injections cause blood clots in recipients. There is a series of events that must first take place inside the body before the blood clots form.  Still, AstraZeneca’s injection is reportedly causing far fewer deaths than Pfizer’s, and yet neither Israel nor the United States has hit the pause button on its administration.  Not only that, but the J&J jab, which causes deadly blood clots just like AstraZeneca’s jab, is now being actively recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in American patients, albeit with a tiny safety warning on the package.  “According to Central Bureau of Statistics data during January-February 2021, at the peak of the Israeli mass vaccination campaign, there was a 22% increase in overall mortality in Israel compared with the previous year,” the Israeli report further explains about what is happening over there.  “In fact, January-February 2021 have been the deadliest months in the last decade, with the highest overall mortality rates compared to corresponding months in the last 10 years.”  The most dramatic increases in death are occurring among Israelis between the ages of 20 and 29. This group has seen an overall increase in mortality of 32 percent ever since the Pfizer vaccine was introduced.  “According to this estimate, it is possible to estimate the number of deaths in Israel in proximity of the vaccine, as of today, at about 1000-1100 people.”																
116	0	COVER-UP: 100% of Covid-19 Vaccine Deaths Were Caused by Just 5% of the Batches Produced According to Official Government Data SM / November 13, 2021 Source – theexpose.uk  “...An investigation of data found in the USA’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has revealed that extremely high numbers of adverse reactions and deaths have been reported against specific lot numbers of the Covid-19 vaccines several times, meaning deadly batches of the experimental injections have now been identified. But what’s perhaps more concerning is that the “deadly” lots were distributed widely across the United States whilst other “benign” lots were sent to just a few locations” 100% of Covid-19 Vaccine Deaths were caused by just 5% of the batches produced according to official Government data An investigation of data found in the USA’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has revealed that extremely high numbers of adverse reactions and deaths have been reported against specific lot numbers of the Covid-19 vaccines several times, meaning deadly batches of the experimental injections have now been identified.  But what’s perhaps more concerning is that the “deadly” lots were distributed widely across the United States whilst other “benign” lots were sent to just a few locations.   The data used in the investigation was pulled from the publicly accessible VAERS database which can be viewed here. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a United States programme for vaccine safety, co-managed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The programme collects information via reports made by doctors, nurses, and patients about adverse events (possible harmful side effects) that occur after administration of vaccines to ascertain whether the risk–benefit ratio is high enough to justify continued use of any particular vaccine.  The reports pulled from the database were ones that had been submitted up to October 15th 2021 and they included all adverse reactions reported against the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA Covid-19 injections, as well as all adverse reactions reported against the influenza vaccines; which were used to generate a control dataset .   The VAERS database showed a total of 1,608 adverse event reports against the flu vaccines alongside 15 deaths and 73 hospitalisations. The total count of lot numbers returned was 494.  The ‘lot number’ is a specific string of numbers and letters that tracks a specific batch of vaccine from production and into a persons arm and it is usually found on a vaccine label or accompanying packaging.   The above chart shows the number of adverse event report made to VAERS against the influenza vaccines sorted by the lot number of vaccine that was administered prior to the adverse event.  Except for a few spikes the number of adverse events per lot number was generally the same, with no more than 26 reports being made against a single lot number of influenza vaccine.   The above charts shows the count of lots by number of reports of adverse reactions per lot for the influenza vaccines. It shows that 33% of the lots (165 / 494) only had a single adverse reaction report made against them, whilst just 0.6% of the lots (3 / 494) had at least 20 adverse reaction reports made against them.   The above chart shows how many times a specific lot number was identified in an adverse reaction report of which the person had died following vaccination against the Flu. Ninety-seven-percent of the lots (480 / 494) were associated with zero deaths, whilst 13 lots were associated with a single death and 1 lot was associated with 2 deaths.   The above chart shows the number of states within the USA a specific log number of the influenza vaccine was distributed to.  The VAERS data shows that 44% of the lots (219 / 494) were sent to just a single state within the USA, whilst a further 17% (86 / 494) were sent to 2 states, 10% (50 / 494) were sent to 3 states, 5% (24 / 494) were sent to 4 states, 3% (17 / 494) were sent to 5 states, 2% (11 / 494) were sent to 6 states, and just 0.4 (2 / 494) were sent to 12 states within the USA.  All of the above data was then used as a control dataset to compare against VAERS data for the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA Covid-19 vaccines.   The VAERS database showed a total of 171,463 adverse event reports against the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine alongside 2,828 deaths and 14,262 hospitalisations. The total count of lot numbers returned was 4,522.  This data alone shows that there have been 106 times as many adverse reactions, 189 times as many deaths, and 195 times as many hospitalisations due to the Pfizer Covid-19 jab than there have been due to all other influenza vaccines combined.   The above chart shows the number of adverse event reports made to VAERS against the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine sorted by the lot number of vaccine that was administered prior to the adverse event. We do not have reliable information about standard lot size, but news articles indicate an average lot size of 1000 vials (approx. 6000 doses).  The highest number of adverse event reports made to VAERS against a single lot number of the influenza vaccine was 26. Which makes it all the more shocking to discover that the highest number of adverse event reports made to VAERS against a single lot number of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine up to October 15th 2021 was 3,563, and this isn’t an anomaly.  Thousands of adverse event reports have been made against a single lot number of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine numerous times, and unfortunately the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine hasn’t fared any better.   The VAERS database showed a total of 188,998 adverse event reports against the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine alongside 2,603 deaths and 10,225 hospitalisations. The total count of lot numbers returned was 5,510.  This data alone shows that there have been 118 times as many adverse reactions, 174 times as many deaths, and 140 times as many hospitalisations due to the Moderna Covid-19 jab than there have been due to all other influenza vaccines combined.   The above chart shows the number of adverse event reports made to VAERS against the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine sorted by the lot number of vaccine that was administered prior to the adverse event, and it shows that the Moderna jab fared even worse than the Pfizer jab in this department with the highest number of adverse event reports against a single lot number of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine totalling a staggering 4,967.   The above chart shows the count of lots against the range of adverse events reported per lot of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. The data reveals that 2,908 lots (64%) had just a single adverse event report made against them, whilst 2 specific lots had over 3000 adverse event reports made against them.  Shockingly we can also see from the data that 30 lots of Pfizer vaccine had between 1,000 and 1,499 adverse event reports per lot, another 20 lots had between 1,500 and 1,999 adverse event reports per lot, and another 23 lots had between 2,000 and 2,499 adverse event reports per lot.  This suggests that there were a small quantity of dangerous batches of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine and a large quantity of seemingly harmless (at least in the short term) batches of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine.   But the investigation of VAERS data also revealed that reported deaths due to the Pfizer vaccine were again only associated with certain batches of the jab. The chart above shows that 96% of the lots of Pfizer vaccine had zero death reports made against them. Meaning the 2,828 reported deaths were associated with just 4% of the lots of Pfizer vaccine.  Five lot numbers were associated with 61-80 deaths each, a further 5 lot numbers were associated with 81-100 deaths each, and just 2 separate lot numbers were associated with over 100 deaths each.   The same can be seen for the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. Ninety-five-percent of the lots of Moderna vaccine had zero death reports made against them. Meaning the 2,603 deaths were associated with just 5% of the lots of Moderna vaccine.  Thirteen lot numbers were associated with 41-60 deaths each, 2 lot numbers were associated with 61-80 deaths each and 1 lot number was associated with 81-100 deaths.  The investigation of VAERS data also found that specific batches of the pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines which were distributed to between 13 and 50 states across the USA had an unusually high number of adverse event reports and deaths compared to lots that were distributed to 12 states or less across the USA   As you can see from the above table 4,289 different lots of Pfizer vaccine were distributed to 12 states or less across the USA, recording 9,141 adverse event reports against them alongside 99 deaths and 657 hospitalisations. This equates to an average of 2 adverse event reports per lot and 0 deaths and hospitalisations.  However, a further 130 different lots of Pfizer vaccine were distributed to between 13-50 states across the USA, recording 166,170 adverse event reports, 2,799 deaths, and 14,155 hospitalisations. This equates to an average of 1,278 adverse event reports per lot number, alongside 22 deaths and 109 hospitalisations.  This data therefore shows that each lot from the 130 different lot numbers of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine distributed to more than 13 states, harmed on average 639 times more people, hospitalised on average 109 times more people, and killed on average 22 times more people.   The above chart on the left shows the number of adverse event reports by lot number sent to 13 or more states across the USA. This chart has identified the actual lot numbers of Pfizer vaccine that have caused the most harm in the USA. The most harmful of which is lot number ‘EK9231’; causing over 3,500 adverse event reports.   The above chart on the left shows the number of deaths reported as adverse reactions to the Pfizer vaccine by lot number sent to 13+ states across the USA. This chart has identified the actual lot numbers of Pfizer vaccine that have caused the most deaths in the USA. The deadliest of which is lot number ‘EN6201’ causing almost 120 deaths.   The above chart on the left shows the number of adverse event reports against the Moderna vaccine by lot number sent to 13 or more states across the USA. This chart has identified the actual lot numbers of Moderna vaccine that have caused the most harm in the USA. The most harmful of which is lot number ‘039K20A’; causing over 4,000 adverse event reports.  The second most harmful batch of Moderna vaccine was assigned lot number ‘041L20A’, and media reports show that it was actually recalled by the Orange County Healthcare Agency in January 2021 following reports of allergic reactions.   Source  The above chart on the left shows the number of deaths reported as adverse reactions to the Moderna vaccine by lot number sent to 13+ states across the USA. This chart has identified the actual lot numbers of Moderna vaccine that have caused the most deaths in the USA. The deadliest of which is lot number ‘039K20A’ causing almost 100 deaths.  Conclusion This investigation of VAERS data reveals several concerning findings which warrant further investigation, but it also leads to questions of why authorities within the USA which are supposed to monitor the safety of the Covid-19 vaccines have not discovered this themselves.  The data clearly shows that the Covid-19 vaccination campaign has been significantly more harmful and deadly than the influenza vaccination campaign. This fact alone begs the question as to how the FDA advisory committee could possibly vote Seventeen to Zero in favour of approving the Pfizer vaccine for use in children aged 5 to 11.  One voting member of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee admitted that it will not be fully known whether Pfizer’s vaccine is safe for 5 to 11-year-old children, until it begins being administered.  Dr Eric Rubin of Harvard University said – “We’re never going to learn how safe the vaccine is unless we start giving it, and that’s just the way it goes”.  But the investigation of VAERS has also identified the specific batches of Pfizer and Moderna vaccine that have caused the most harm across the USA, which leads to other extremely serious questions requiring urgent answers.  Why is it that certain batches of the vaccine have proven to be more harmful than others?  Why is it that certain batches of Covid-19 vaccine have proven to be deadlier than others?  Why is it that the most harmful and deadly Covid-19 vaccines were distributed across the entire USA, whilst the least harmful and deadly were only ever distributed to a few states? Was this done on purpose?  Could this just be a quality control issue?  A Pfizer whistleblower from a Kansas manufacturing facility did after all reveal that “People are being made to sign off on things that normally they wouldn’t, and then they wonder why their own employees won’t take it”

TRANSCRIPT  Many are now awakened to the harsh reality of depopulation and democide, in which we find ourselves today and the end game is out in the open: to destroy humanity under the guise of transhumanism.  What we’ve unfortunately learned is that there is an overwhelming herd of us who will do whatever they are told by the system, which explains how we’ve gotten this far.  There are seemingly millions who will believe whatever pop culture tells them, including the mass-denial of natural health and immunity, while attempting to criminalize a knowledge base spanning millennia. Corporate pop prostitutes spew talking points for Big Pharma’s mRNA mystery cocktail as the only solution.  And if the solution is less people, which is what the elitists have been saying for decades, then they are succeeding. Multiple studies conducted in the UK show that after the vaccine was introduced, COVID deaths increased by over 1000%. And more than half of all COVID deaths and hospitalizations are from the fully-vaccinated.  The numbers in New York City are showing the same. Experts in the field, including the inventor of the mRNA technique being used had been warning about this since the beginning – but silenced by the corporate media.  Project Veritas has recently exposed how doctors and nurses are well-aware of the danger of the mRNA jabs but care more about their own jobs and how Big Pharma low-level employees care only about the numbers.  It is an all-out attack against the human race.  We knew this a year ago, because we knew their white papers, which is why we know what comes next, brought to you by the same characters behind the mRNA vaccine. What comes next is the end of natural, organic humanity and the beginning of man’s own version.  Man, fused with machine in a lab. The End.  There is no more hiding the end game. It’s out in the open, where only the un-brainwashed can see it.  Ultimately, it will be up to the people.  The police in Australia are loyally serving their Globalist masters. What makes you think anything will be any different in America?  A flight surgeon for the US Army has warned that all vaccinated pilots are unfit to fly. The US military is being destroyed from within. The only way through to freedom is for the people to say “no”, which is now starting to happen all across the world.  Humanity uniting together as the human race, standing up against the most sophisticated tyranny that mankind has ever faced, all while the pop culture media machine ignores it.  A worldwide peaceful revolution of the people is a numbers game, so continuing to wake people up is our road to liberation.  Do not remain silent during this dire time at the crossroads of human history. It is the truth that shall set us free.																
118	0	Journalist Celia Farber just wrote an explosive article on the Pfizer secret document. You should read it. She deserves our thanks and gratitude. And here you can also read the document itself.  In short, the Pfizer document (which was never supposed to see the light of day but was disclosed as part of a FOIA suit) describes the adverse effects from just the first three months of injections with the company’s COVID vaccine:  158,000 adverse events, 1223 deaths. In a half-sane world, this would have been more than enough to halt all injections and cancel the vaccine.  TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/  I’ve queried two attorneys. They both looked at the Pfizer document and state they believe it’s authentic.  The appendix of the Pfizer document is the most astonishing section. It’s beyond astonishing. It lists all the types of vaccine adverse events Pfizer logged—again, in just three months of injections.  Page after page after page after page of types of adverse events. Each type of event cast in medical language, the language of the dead. The proponents of this technical-ese speak, as it were, from beyond the grave. They’re super-educated brainwashed zombies. It’s as if they’re listing and counting abstractions in an academic board game.  The abstractions raise no concerns. In the document, no one is waving red flags. They’re all medical bean counters, keeping their books with precision.  Make no mistake, these are the people who are operating the levers of society on a day-to-day basis, maiming and killing with a confident attitude that indicates they are beyond reproach. The very notion of reproach is foreign to them.  Civilization is drowning. It’s drowning in a giant lake of TECHNIQUE. The uses to which technique is put have become irrelevant. Just follow procedure. Carry out assigned tasks. Pass along information. Report on results. And then you will have achieved immunity from blame.  Or resist and rebel no matter what. These are the stakes. This is the war.  Get ready. Buckle up.

119	0	How to Reduce the World’s Population by 90% Opinion below by guest writer starlight432 precedes the article by HalTurnerRadio:  December 22, 2020 I have a bit of an ability to do mind-reading, and maybe I was able to get inside the minds of the cabal. Here’s their possible (probable?) plan:  The vaccines will be lethal, not killing immediately, but in the near future by destroying the immune system and so forth. The vaccine deaths (from those who at first choose to get vaccinated) will be blamed and recorded as deaths from the new Covid strain. Because we are saying that our vaccines also protect against the new Covid strain, the artificially higher mortality from the new Covid strain (vaccine deaths) will be used as leverage to force vaccinate the rest of the population. Also, make a small portion of the vaccines nonlethal, in a form that shuts down higher faculties in order to have a small portion of the population survive as our mindless slaves (~500 million). A population of 7.5 billion people is too great to be controlled, but ~500 million mindless slaves is a different story.  End Time Madness, The Days to Come – James Gilliland Trending End Time Madness, The Days to Come – James Gilliland https://starlight432.blogspot.com/2020/12/how-to-reduce-worlds-population-by-90.html Then Hal Turner came up with this in an update today: “I am getting a lot of bullshit emails from biochemists telling me that the evil data about SM-102 has to do with the fact that it is delivered via a solution of Chloroform and the hazards listed on the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) deal with Chloroform. No, they don’t. The MSDS deals with the substance SM-102 as it is manufactured by Cayman Chemical Company. Period.The ingredients list in the Moderna COVID ‘Vaccine” lists SM-102 as the third most-prevalent ingredient in the vaccine, and that ingredient is as the Cayman Chemical Company describes it. It’s that simple.But this actually gets worse. Chloroform is the solution used with the SM-102 and Chloroform has been outlawed for use by consumers for decades.  The reason Chloroform is outlawed for use by consumers has to do with how long it stays in a human body and what it does to a human body while it’s inside. The Half-Life of Chloroform is 180 days. That means that it takes half a YEAR for only HALF of the chloroform, to be exited out of the body. You with me so far?  Chloroform, like any other chemical, breaks down. And when it comes into contact with oxygen, it breaks down into . . . . wait for it . . . . Phosgene Gas.  Phosgene gas is fatal to humans in concentrations as low as seven parts per million (7ppm).  So all these folks getting the “jab” are getting an arm full of Chloroform which, as it circulates through their bodies will break down into phosgene gas.  Depending upon the unique functions of various people, some — maybe many — of those people MIGHT reach the fatal threshold of phosgene gas in their system, and die from it; likely within 180 days after the second “jab.”  But wait, there’s even MORE! Phosgene is a highly toxic substance that exists as a gas at room temperature. Owing to its poor water solubility, one of the hallmarks of phosgene toxicity is an unpredictable asymptomatic latent phase before the development of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Yes, the lungs fill with fluid and the patient can’t breathe. Just like . . . . wait for it . . . . “COVID.”  As these people start dropping like flies, the very same people who brought us the vaccine can simply blame it on a COVID variant. Gee, too bad they died from a COVID variant that the vaccine couldn’t protect them from.  Would that be plausible deniability for mass murder? You decide.  Great way to depopulate the planet and no one is the wiser because the deaths are so chronologically distant from the jab and the symptoms of phosgene gas poisoning mimic the symptoms of COVID.” From the Halturnerradioshow.com:  The Connecticut Department of Public Health has published the Ingredients list for the Moderna COVID “Vaccine” and that data sheet confirms it contains a chemical “SM-102.”  The SM-102 Material Safety Data Sheet describes this chemical as “NOT FOR HUMAN OR VETERINARY USE”  Here is the information published by the Connecticut Department of Health about the Moderna COVID Vaccine, which lists its INGREDIENTS:    More:  According to the manufacturer, Cayman Chemical Company in their filing with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), this chemical causes “Acute Toxicity “Fatal in contact with skin.”  In that same OSHA filing, the manufacturer declares SM-102  “Causes damage to the central nervous system, the kidneys, the liver and the respiratory system through prolonged or repeated exposure.”   Here are two sections from the manufacturer’s OSHA filing:         This appears to be what they are injecting into YOUR arm when you take the Moderna COVID Vax.  You are APPARENTLY being POISONED!  Perhaps this is why so many people are having “adverse reactions” to the so-called “vaccine?”  Yet Health departments all over this country are running TV and Radio ads telling the general public this vaccine is “safe.”  That seems to be FALSE ADVERTISING.  The full information release from the Connecticut Department of health, listing the ingredients, can be downloaded directly from the Connecticut State Government web site HERE   (Archived HERE)  The full Material Data Safety Sheet on Chemical “SM-102” can be downloaded from the Cayman Chemical Company web site HERE   (Archived HERE)  Now that this information is out, YOU may wish to carefully re-think whether or not you want someone injecting this into YOU.  For those who made the decision to get this vaccine, you may want to get in touch with a good personal injury lawyer and present this information to that attorney.   (While you’re still alive.)     UPDATE MAY 18  12:30 PM EDT —  I am getting a lot of emails from biochemists telling me that the evil data about SM-102 has to do with the fact that it is delivered via a solution of Chloroform and the hazards listed on the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) deal with Chloroform.  No, they don’t.  The MSDS deals with the substance SM-102 as it is manufactured by Cayman Chemical Company.  Period.

Great way to depopulate the planet and no one is the wiser because the deaths are so chronologically distant from the jab and the symptoms of phosgene gas poisoning mimic the symptoms of COVID.     HAL TURNER EDITORIAL OPINION  Clearly very many of you made the decision to receive this vaccine based on deliberately false claims by politicians, celebrities, public health officials,  TV and Radio Stations, the print and electronic NEWS MEDIA (ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, CNBS, etc.) and perhaps others, that told YOU these vaccines were “safe.”  Why were they out there telling people this was “safe” when the ingredients list clearly shows a chemical “not for human … use” that is known to “cause cancer” and “damage to central nervous system . . .”  Maybe THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD BE SUED for what their false information has done to you. Where was their Due Diligence?  Did they even bother to look up the ingredients before they went out and told the public this was “safe?”  Oh, and how about social media giants (with deep pockets) like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Google/Youtube? They not only pushed false information, but also actively and aggressively BLOCKED truthful information about the bad reactions taking place, and CENSORED or SHUT OFF accounts trying to get facts to the public. What price should they pay for what they’ve done?  Their CENSORSHIP seems to have been an effort to aid and abet the flow of false safety information which ultimately may have damaged YOU!  Maybe the social media companies need to get sued too?  I can’t help but feel that if the big mouth, holier-than-thou celebrities, actors, left-wing media pundits, and politicians, all find themselves getting sued for what they’ve publicly told people to do, maybe these folks will (finally) shut up . . . or go out of business.  How about state Governors?  Guys like New York’s Andrew Cuomo and my home state of New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, or the wretched woman, Gretchen Whitmer, out in Michigan; out there almost every day for MONTHS telling people “Get vaccinated, it’s safe.”  What should happen with folks like that who pushed this toxic and deadly chemical on residents of entire states?  Those of you who work or attend school at places where the bosses or school administration REQUIRED you to get the vaccine as a condition of continued employment or condition of attending school, maybe THEY SHOULD GET SUED AS WELL.  OSHA has made clear that when an employer REQUIRES people to take an experimental vaccine, the employer is responsible under Workman’s Compensation Laws for any injuries or deaths caused by their requirement!  A lot of these people seem to think they’re so much smarter than everyone else, and they somehow needed to tell all us “little people” what was best for us.  Let them explain how injecting a cancer-causing chemical clearly labelled NOT FOR HUMAN USE, was “good” for us. Let’s see what a jury thinks of that.  Let their vast personal intellect, that they seem to think makes them so much smarter than the rest of us, hit their pocketbook; maybe they’ll start minding their own business . . . if they have a business left after all these lawsuits!  Given the information above, it seems to me that people who took the Moderna “jab” are likely to get sicker and sicker until they die.  Maybe I’m wrong.   Yet the Material Safety Data Sheet clearly states “Causes damage to the central nervous system, the kidneys, the liver and the respiratory system through prolonged or repeated exposure”  so to me, that means every time your heart beats and your blood flows, that chemical is REPEATEDLY hitting the cells in your body.  To me, that makes it “prolonged and repeated exposure.”  Those of you who are suffering from “the jab” should ask a lawyer.  Of course, the lawyer may tell you the vaccine companies were granted immunity as a condition of releasing their experimental vaccine.  But the US Supreme Court has held in the past that “fraud vitiates everything” (See “UNITED STATES v. THROCKMORTON” 98 U.S. 61) and if these vaccine companies told the government their vaccine was “safe” when their own ingredients list says otherwise, then it may be that those companies committed fraud . . . and . . .  fraud vitiates everything.  Thus, maybe a court holds those vaccine companies have NO immunity?  Of course, proving fraud is a tough legal thing to do.  But maybe this will help; Pharmaceutical Companies are required to put an INSERT into their products that list ingredients and all known side effects.   But as the images below will show, those inserts boxed with the “vaccines” . . . .  ARE BLANK!      Now, I’m no pharmaceutical expert, so I don’t know why the companies left this insert blank.  Someone I know worked for a big pharmaceutical MANUFACTURER,  and he told me that these inserts are called “Ancillary labels” and when he worked in the industry, he was instructed by the company that these are an FDA requirement; they could not ship product without them.  Yet, Moderna (and some others) shipped product with blank inserts.  Why?  Were they worried people would look up the ingredients, find out they’re not for human or veterinary use, and go bonkers?  In criminal law, might the decision to use blank inserts be “consciousness of guilt?”  I’m not an attorney, so I don’t have the answers.  Those of you who have NOT taken the vaccine, should maybe think an awful lot longer before you do.   UPDATE 8:21 AM WEDNESDAY 19 MAY 2021 —  The Facebook “Fact-Checker” Leadstories.com was asked by Facebook to do a story about THIS story, and Facebook itself has labeled this article “FALSE” – likely because their company is named as a source which should be sued for what they’ve been doing concerning the Moderna Vaccine.  It seems natural they would want to discredit the facts cited herein to protect themselves from a lawsuit.  The Leadstories article quotes a Biologist involved with Animal studies on the Moderna vaccine as saying this article uses “the wrong data sheet” from SM-102, but they do NOT provide any alternate data sheet to substantiate their claim.  There does not appear to be ANY other data sheet for any substance identified as SM-102.  Moreover, the biologist they quote failed to disclose that most of the animals studied with the Moderna vaccine . . . DIED from it during the animal testing studies and that so many animals died, they sought, and were granted, a  WAIVER to stop the animal studies and go directly to experimental human use.  Apparently, we humans are now the study creatures for this so-called “vaccine” which may be why over four thousand people have died in the USA after taking the Moderna vaccine.  We stand-by the accuracy of this story.																
120	0	Covid-19 vaccines are a very insidious way to attack people and their immune systems because most people are not even capable of understanding the science behind the manufacture of these experimental vaccines. It is hard to question the science if you would not even understand the answers given, and scientists and doctors know this. Yet, if you knew exactly what the mRNA vaccines are capable of, you would not only think twice before taking this experimental new “vaccine,” but you would simply say, “no way. FIRST, UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF “ENCODED PROTEIN MOLECULES” Back in 2008, some doctors translated what it means for cells to convert DNA into working proteins, a process they described as a “decoding of instructions” for making proteins, involving mRNA transcription. The workhorses of the human cell are encoded protein molecules that help the body metabolize nutrients, meaning life-sustaining chemical reactions that convert food into energy and remove metabolic waste. In other words, encoded protein molecules perform functions that are necessary for all human life, and that is what this vaccine technology is manipulating.  With mRNA vaccine technology, the information in your DNA that is transferred to messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules is altered. This manipulation is called transcription, and during this process the mRNA is “read” by its newly mutated genetic code, and its genetic code is the new template for the chain of amino acids that will form a protein. This is where it gets really scary.  Scientists are now fully capable of transcribing, translating and mutating genes. Scientists now believe they have enough research to fully profile these transcripts of cells with the complete set of RNA transcripts. This research explains why mRNA vaccines have a tremendous impact on cell functioning, and why so many deadly “side effects” have already been observed, including severe blood clots, excruciating nerve pain, blindness, deafness, and death.  MESSENGER RNA IS AN RNA MOLECULE THAT ENCODES A SPECIFIC “CHEMICAL BLUEPRINT” THAT CAN BE DEADLY TO HUMANS The manufacturers of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine series all have one thing in common: manipulating the orchestration of almost every function of the human cell using vaccines. Make no mistake, the protein “gene products” that are artificially produced, thanks to the mRNA vaccines, can affect life as we know it, and easily for the worse.  These filthy vaccines pushed so hard by Bill Gates, the EU and the health authorities, are capable of manipulating your cells into producing mutated proteins (prions) that, like cancer, multiply uncontrollably. The vaccines, in summary, convert the genetic information encoded in your DNA into new gene products that can even be passed on to the next generation.  That means a wave of deformed, immune-compromised children could be the next “Generation X” born into this demented world of chemical medicine and biological warfare. Will all the new children of mRNA-inoculated parents have severe autism and incipient dementia? Time will tell.  Realize that these genetic codes that the vaccine manufacturers are rewriting with mRNA are universal genetic codes, like a blueprint, with only a few exceptions. That means that virtually everyone who receives the Covid-19 vaccine series injections will produce the same mutated, horrible genetic code for protein and prion synthesis.  Dr. Richard Fleming, a nuclear cardiologist and physicist, has already warned humanity recently about the dangers of getting the Covid vaccines, saying that they can cause mad cow disease by instructing human cells to produce horribly dangerous “spike proteins” without any control over how much or how fast they are produced. It’s like stage 4 cancer, where it spreads so quickly that there is almost no hope of living on.  That’s why so many injections are already causing blood clots. In animal models tested in laboratories (which the mainstream media will never report on), test animals developed the deadly spongiforms (mad cow disease) just two weeks after being injected with mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. These spongiforms cause neurological disorders and dementia, according to Dr. Fleming.																
121	0	The truth about Covid Vaccines is they are killing people, while hospitals are murdering the rest.  The CDC and FDA prefer that you not read this article. They don’t want you to find out exactly how many people have been killed by the vaccines. They don’t want you to know the truth.  The Truth About Covid Vaccines – Covid Vaccines are designed to kill people. The CDC, FDA and government are lying to you about vaccines.  We are in a silent war with governments around the world. Governments and Big Pharma have been silencing people on social media, at the workplace, turning people against one another and still enforcing ridiculous mask mandates after 1.5 years.  On July 15, 2021, the US Surgeon General called COVID misinformation an “urgent threat.”  The White House is working with social media companies to ban “medical disinformation” by “conspiracy theorists” (truth seekers.)  If you question anything by government or any entity, then GOOD FOR YOU!  Only a fool would blindly do as they’re told, especially when their health or life is at stake.  PODCAST version of The Truth About Covid Vaccines What Press Secretary Jen Psaki neglects to say is that the biggest misinformation is coming from the CDC, FDA, and NIH. These organizations do not want you to know how many people have been killed or permanently disabled by the COVID vaccines. They want you to believe that early treatments don’t work.  They don’t want you to know their own data shows that for the alpha variant, vaccination only makes sense if you are over 30 years old and for the delta variant, because it is nearly 7 times less deadly; vaccination makes no sense at all: for all ages.  The Covid “vaccine” will kill more people than it will save. Early treatments are the superior alternative: they are proven in practice to have a higher risk reduction and better safety profile than any of the current vaccines. Early treatments include less stress, eating better, getting proper rest, drinking plenty of fluids, etc.  Here is the death count in the official database (VAERS: vaccine adverse event reporting system) that is used by the CDC and FDA to track adverse events (as of Jul 10, 2021.)  The truth about Covid Vaccines. We are in a silent war with governments around the world. Governments and Big Pharma have been silencing people on social media, at the workplace, turning people against one another and still enforcing ridiculous mask mandates after 1.5 years.  The 9,048 deaths  might be under-counted by a factor of 10 or more, according to a report commissioned by the NIH.  When you consider that the rate of reporting this year was about the same as previous years (there were just a lot more events and we can prove this), we could be looking at well over 100,000 deaths caused by the vaccines in the US alone.  But the other thing you have to consider is that the 300 to 500 deaths each year on that chart are almost all “background deaths” that are coincidental because people die every day.  The actual deaths caused by previous vaccines are fewer than 10 per year reported to VAERS. So when cases spike to close to 10,000 death reports in the first 6 months, and the propensity to report hasn’t changed at all (which we can show), something is very seriously wrong.  What The Vaccine Is Doing To Humanity – Christiane Northrup   This video is for all the disbelievers in the supposed Conspiracy Theory that they’re out to depopulate the world. The truth always comes out in the end. Covid-19 shots are not vaccines, but deadly bioweapons designed to kill human beings.  The Covid-19 hoax is a long planned agenda that has been put in place and orchestrated by the psychopathic Governments around the world, to destroy our lives, take away our freedoms and control us forever.  If people don’t wake up now and refuse to take these vaccines, it could be what really ends up destroying civilization all together, which is exactly what Governments want to happen..  There is no scientific proof or the existence of the Covid19 virus, as it has NEVER been isolated, purified in a laboratory using Kochs Postulates or demonstrated under an electron microscope.  PCR test shows only an RNA sequence COMPUTER model of the virus, not a real virus.  The truth about Covid Vaccines. We are in a silent war with governments around the world. Governments and Big Pharma have been silencing people on social media, at the workplace, turning people against one another and still enforcing ridiculous mask mandates after 1.5 years.  No one has seen how this “virus” looks in reality. The problem is what they are showing in “positive” PCR tests is our body’s own harmless exosomes which look exactly like Covid-19.  The scientist who invented the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test is Kary B. Mullis. According to Mullis himself, PCR should never be used as a tool in “the diagnosis of infectious diseases.” These tests do not detect viruses or infectious diseases, but RNA which we all have.  Anyone who takes a PCR test will test positive for Covid-19 because of harmless exosomes and something called amplification. They increase amplification for more positive cases and decrease it for more negative cases. They can have as many or as little cases they like to push the Covid-19 agenda. That is how they pull of the great Covid-19 plandemic hoax. Its all smoke, mirrors, deceptions and lies!  We have been demanding the Government provide evidence that that this virus actually exists [as well as] evidence that lockdowns actually have any impact on the spread of viruses; that face-masks are safe, and do deter the spread of viruses – They don’t. No such studies exist; social distancing is based in science – It isn’t. Contact tracing has any bearing on the spread of a virus – of course it doesn’t. The Governments are making it up as they go along, as they have with all other hoaxes…911 being one of them.  Share your thoughts on The Truth About Covid Vaccines in the comments section below.

122	0	Prominent German virologist Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi is once again calling out the lies about the pandemic, highlighting several in a virtual address he gave to a massive anti-lockdown demonstration in Austria on January 31st. His main three messages are that healthy people do not spread the coronavirus, vaccines are “extremely dangerous” and even deadly, and there is no “savior” coming to stop arbitrary and unscientific lockdowns.  “Stand up against this insanity and end it,” he said.  Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi’s address, which has already been “fact checked” by laughably biased fact checkers, has been exclusively translated for RAIR Foundation USA. While his address is short, it is very important. He explains importantly that there is no such thing as asymptomatic spread and simply, he says, “healthy people aren’t dangerous”.  Referencing his inability to be present at the “banned” rally in Vienna, Dr. Bhakdi said: “They’re very efficient at forbidding people to gather together, in an attempt to prevent us from communicating with one another.”  “What is happening is all expressly intentional and deliberate,” he continued.  Dr. Bhakdi praised the participants for their courage, and said “is so good that despite all this you gathered together in such large numbers…” Riot police were present during the rally, and were reportedly weary of facing potential riots such as those that occurred in the Netherlands last month in the wake of further lockdown restrictions including a curfew, demands for people to “‘avoid talking or making phone calls’ in subways, buses or anywhere in public” and “to use medical grade masks rather than homemade fabric face masks…”   Rioting in the Netherlands (YouTube Screenshot) Dr. Bhakdi explains that the premise that asymptomatic people are still dangerous to one another “was created by inaccurate reporting and inaccurate model calculations” but the lie continues to be perpetuated “from those in power in government and the media.” This got under the skin of a “fact-checker” who meekly claimed that “there is no conclusive status, but contradicting studies” on this point.  Reuters, who admitted in their article that “[T]he affiliation of many of Sunday’s protesters was not immediately clear,” still had no problem smearing the protesters as “far right.” They additionally reported that Vienna police “banned numerous protests planned for this weekend, including one by the far-right Freedom Party…” Despite the ban, the crowd was estimated at 5,000 and was likely much higher.  “There is NO asymptomatic contagion from the illness COVID-19,” but the vaccine is “extremely dangerous,” he said, claiming that people have “have already died” from it. He continues:  Young people have died from this vaccine. This is being hidden, covered up, and no one wants to talk about it. I’m someone who has always been transparent.  I have only said what I have been compelled to say because it is scientifically proven.

Please consider making a donation here: https://rairfoundation.com/donate/  Transcript (Many thanks to Miss Piggy for the translation!):  My dear fellow citizens,  I would have loved to be with you, among you today. I would gladly be there.  However, those in power are very efficient at restricting travel.  They’re very efficient at forbidding people to gather together, in an attempt to prevent us from communicating with one another.  What is happening is all expressly intentional and deliberate.  I hope you never lose your courage and I think it is so good that despite all this you gathered together in such large numbers today.  Without masks, without social distancing and without all the nonsensical restrictions that those in power demand from you, from us.  I have a short, but very positive message.  Namely, that it is untrue that there is still a pandemic.  It is untrue.  You need to know that the definition of a COVID case was changed, not officially, but unofficially, about eleven days ago.  On January 20th the W.H.O. advised that the use of these numerous PCR tests for diagnosing COVID-19 can’t produce diagnostic results without matching symptoms.  There are NO “healthy” positives.  That would mean, all these numbers that they are using to abuse you collapse like a house of cards. My second message is incredibly exciting.  It is now well-known, and probably the reason why the W.H.O. made this suggestion, because it isn’t a guideline, telling those in power to take into account that healthy people aren’t dangerous. You aren’t dangerous. It is an established fact. It is quite clear that this entire fairytale — well, it isn’t a fairytale, it is has been a nightmare.  This idea that healthy people could be dangerous for others was created by inaccurate reporting and inaccurate model calculations.  Above all, it is due to the inaccurate reporting coming from those in power in government and the media.  There is NO asymptomatic contagion from the illness COVID-19.  That’s very good news. There’s more news that isn’t so good.  The vaccination program was started and is now being distributed.  That was the deciding factor why I would have loved to be there in Vienna.  I plead with you, please inform yourselves.  This vaccine is extremely dangerous. People have already died from it.  Young people have died from this vaccine. This is being hidden, covered up, and no one wants to talk about it. I’m someone who has always been transparent.  I have only said what I have been compelled to say because it is scientifically proven.  In this context, I am not speaking to you as someone with political motives, and I don’t have a political agenda. I’m not on the left nor am I on the right. I stand with you.  This vaccine is so dangerous, that we dedicated an entire chapter to it called “Immunity and Immunization”.  And it was made available to everyone. You can download this chapter, for free, at the publisher’s homepage, Goldegg-Verlag. (See English-Translated Book here)  Just do a search for our book, there you will find a link. Please take the time to read it.  It takes two hours at the most. When you are finished you will know so much more than the experts, the politicians and Mr. Kurz. They aren’t informed.  That’s why they are committing what will soon be established as crimes against humanity.  Stay united. Increase your numbers.  Stand up against this insanity and end it.  Only you are able to do that. Nobody else. Please don’t wait for someone to be the savior.  There isn’t one. Either you do it yourself, for yourself.  Most importantly do it for your children and their children.																
123	0	A recent article published in the scientific journal Microbiology and Infectious Diseases makes the claim that the mRNA Pfizer Covid vaccine may contain prions which cause deadly neurodegenerative disease, sometimes called “Creutzfeldt-Jakob” or  “Mad Cow” disease. The article, titled “COVID-19 RNA Based Vaccines and the Risk of Prion Disease,” was published in January of 2021 and has been studiously ignored by major media, which has focused its efforts on encouraging individuals to take the jab.  The paper was authored by J. Bart Classen, MD and analyzed the Pfizer mRNA vaccine, stating that:  The RNA sequence of the vaccine as well as the spike protein target interaction were analyzed for the potential to convert intracellular RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations. The results indicate that the vaccine RNA has specific sequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations.  The paper goes on to state that “The folding of TDP-43 and FUS into their pathologic prion confirmations is known to cause ALS, front temporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological degenerative diseases.” In other words, the Pfizer mRNA vaccine may have the  capability of turning brains to mush.  Far from prompting any pause or calls for re-evaluation of the Pfizer vaccine, the media has largely ignored the paper. A few of the more notorious “fact check” websites have pronounced that the conclusions of this study are false.																
124	0	As the Joe Biden White House continues to push its tyrannical mandates, alarming new research has surfaced about the COVID vaccines. Every major mainstream media source is reluctant to discuss the merits of natural immunity.  Few will address the scientific evidence that natural immunity may be multiple times more effective at fighting COVID. However, even more disturbing is the total dismissal of potentially health devastating side effects caused by the vaccination.  Millions of Americans have expressed hesitancy towards getting “the jab”. One reason is many have already recovered from COVID. They question why they need a shot to take care of what their own body is now designed to fight.  Others are hesitant because of the haste in which the COVID vaccines were approved. As an increasing number of potential side effects from the vaccine surface, many people are growing more entrenched in their feelings.  At what risk do you take a vaccine that might do more harm than good? Newly released documents support decisions by those who have been reluctant to get a COVID shot. Attorney Aaron Siri has published an initial report addressing information he demanded from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).  Siri, the Managing Partner of Siri and Glimstad, has considerable experience with civil litigation cases. He has specialized in cases involving lawsuits brought by clients who have endured injuries from vaccinations. It required a civil lawsuit to pry this information from the FDA.  In a discussion with a U.S. Congressional panel led by Senator Ron Johnson, Siri said his law firm had received hundreds of legal requests about COVID vaccination problems. The documents reveal over 150,000 incidents involving side effects have been reported to Pfizer.  Siri proclaimed, “If we actually sued all of the pharmaceutical companies for all of the complaints, it would actually be impossible for all of the attorneys around the country, around 100, to handle all of those matters.”  Of the thousands of documented side effects, the data indicate more than 25,000 of these have directly affected the central nervous system. These numbers become even more disturbing when we consider the period for claims fell within a short two-and-a-half month window.  This timeframe was during the initial months when Pfizer was distributing vaccines under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Pfizer even admits that the company was overwhelmed by, “the large numbers of spontaneous adverse event reports received for the product.”  The alarming ramifications of this data are further supported by shocking revelations within the Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS) for COVID. There have been over 18,000 deaths resulting from the COVID vaccination and nearly 100,000 hospitalizations.  Nearly 100,000 more adverse vaccination incidents have required urgent care. There are thousands of reported cases of Anaphylaxis and Bell’s palsy. No one expected that there wouldn’t be problems with a hastily approved vaccination.  There aren’t many people fighting against the mandates who dispute that the vaccines have at some level been useful. They take issue with the tyrannical mandating of the COVID vaccine. Joe Biden has overstepped his authority. He is not a dictator, although he thinks he is.  The choice to receive a COVID vaccination should be a personal one. It should involve a thorough consideration of individual health circumstances. “The jab” may not be for everyone. The increasingly disturbing number of reported side effects must be part of the conversation. However, the mainstream media refuses to engage in open discussion.  Their reasoning is simple. Fake news doesn’t want to upset their cozy relationship with the radical liberals. Joe Biden and his liberal cronies don’t care about the American people. They feel they have been remanded control over public and personal decisions. They have not.  Joe Biden’s vaccine mandates are not concerned about the health of our nation. They’re a strategy designed to impose complete government control of our lives. Many are resisting a shot because of this issue. However, it’s now obvious that others have viable reasons to refuse the COVID vaccination for legitimate health concerns.																
125	0	The forced mass vaccination of Americans will be regarded as one of the most deadly and costly medical mistakes in history, renowned pioneer in the early treatment of COVID-19, Texas cardiologist and internist Dr. Peter McCullough, has said.  (Article by Celeste McGovern republished from LifeSiteNews.com)  Citing recent data from U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and from Israel and Britain, where COVID cases are multiplying among the vaccinated, McCullough, who is editor-in-chief of two medical journals and author of over 600 peer-reviewed studies, including 46 dedicated to COVID-19, said he is “deeply worried” about the future of America.  “Americans are going to bear the brunt of what invariably is going to be a failed mass vaccination program that will go down as one of the most deadly, one of the most injurious and costly in human history,” McCullough said in a recent podcast.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced in April that it has stopped tracking COVID cases among the vaccinated that do not result in hospitalizations or deaths. The agency is now assuming that new cases are among the unvaccinated unless otherwise advised, which skews numbers to paint the unvaccinated as spreaders of disease.  “This intentional misinformation and propaganda scheme has been used to drive an incredible fury of vaccine mandates” for government agencies, veterans administrations, and hundreds of schools and colleges, even though here have been no outbreaks in these places, McCullough said.  Israel was the first country to mass vaccinate its population under an agreement with Pfizer to exchange vaccine supply for public health data in an experiment on the people “to evaluate whether herd immunity protection is observed during the Product vaccination program rollout.”  Eighty percent of adults are fully vaccinated there, yet COVID cases and serious hospitalizations have risen 20-fold since early July. The media has highlighted that most serious new cases have been among the unvaccinated, while neglecting to report that the majority (more than 80 percent) of new cases reported by the Israeli Health Ministry are among vaccinated individuals.     In response, Israel introduced a third “booster shot” of Pfizer’s vaccine which has been administered to more than one million people as of August 16.  In the United Kingdom, more than three-quarters of the adult population (76 percent) have received two doses of vaccine and almost 90 percent of adults have received at least one dose. Yet, the number of COVID patients hospitalized has soared sevenfold since early June this year.    The most recent U.K. report on “variants of concern” revealed that 54 percent of COVID deaths are among the fully vaccinated. A further 12 percent of deaths are among the partially vaccinated who have received one dose.    That data, McCullough said, “is basically showing that the vaccines are failing.” Vaccinated individuals can acquire and transmit the pandemic coronavirus and become and die of COVID-19. “Completely vaccinated individuals are passing it to one another,” McCullough said.  Nonetheless, citing the new, circulating Delta variant, the Biden administration is expected to follow Israel’s example and introduce a third booster shot for all nursing home residents and healthcare workers for September.     The vaccines were never tested for the Delta variant, and their protection has lasted only months. “It’s clear we can’t vaccinate our way out of this,” McCullough said.  COVID-19, no matter what the variant, is easily treatable at home with simple, available drugs, according to McCullough, who has stated that “about 88 percent of hospitalizations and deaths can be avoided” with early treatment.  Since he came out publicly advising early treatment of COVID patients where the government protocol is to send them home and wait for them to get sick, McCullough has found himself targeted by public health institutions and academia.   A graduate of Baylor University who worked as a Vice Chair of Internal Medicine at Baylor University Medical Center from January 2014 until February 2021, he recently addressed?the Texas Senate Health and Human Service Committee about early COVID-19 treatment protocols.  His contract was then cancelled, and he was recently sued by the Texas-based health system Baylor Scott & White after his affiliation with the system was noted during a public interview.   The lawsuit coincides with a decision by BSWH to mandate vaccination for its 40,000 employees.   “I’m deeply worried concerned regarding the future of America and also deeply afraid of loss of freedom of speech and of scientific discourse,” McCullough said.   “There are deep threats out there to doctors who are really doing their best—to help patients and save lives,” he said   He cited a July 29 statement from the Federation of State Medical Boards which threatens doctors who spread medical “misinformation” about vaccines with losing their medical license. The federation defines scientific information as “consensus-driven for the betterment of public health.”  McCullough openly criticized the “totalitarian” nature of vaccine mandates and pointed to government vaccine adverse event data noting that “already 11,221 declared disabled due to the vaccine.” That number has since grown to 16,044.  “These safety events are way out of line. This vaccine is nowhere close to be safe. Every person who takes the needle is thinking about the scoreboard.”  Instead, he said, “Americans are flying blind. They don’t know which vaccine is the safest.”  “Americans are given no information on this. It is basically impossible for them to navigate this vaccine decision. They say simply: ‘Take the vaccine, and it doesn’t matter which one.'”  “None of this makes sense in terms of the program being about COVID-19; it almost seems like it’s about submissiveness, or coercion, or control. The population is basically being forced into mass vaccination.”  Read more at: LifeSiteNews.com and Vaccines.news.																
126	0	EXCLUSIVE! Karen Kingston, a former Pfizer employee and current analyst for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, came forward with indisputable documentation that should be shared with the ENTIRE WORLD!  The inoculation being referred to as ‘COVID Vaccines’ is a poisonous death sentence, and nobody should subject themselves to the shots.  We have gone back and forth with fact-checkers and some independent researchers who have attempted to debunk the findings of Spanish Researchers called Laquinta Columna, originally broken here on the Stew Peters Show by Dr. Jane Ruby, that video revealing that Graphene Oxide, a toxic poison was found in the Pfizer vaccines. Those researchers later found that the same applied to Moderna and Astrazeneca is being tested as a result of our reporting of the truth here. USA Today, Lead Stories, all funded by the cabal were all over me all over Dr. Ruby and out-and-out calling us liars for reporting those findings to the world in a video that has soared well over a million views on Rumble. We have sought the input of many medical experts and world-renowned doctors who have all confirmed that report. On Twitter, you may have recently been following the hashtag PfizerLeak, we want to know what’s in them, if this was pre-planned, who’s behind all of it and what to believe, so today we’re going to get the confirmation we need.																
127	0	The following is a timely and critical interview with Dr. Peter McCullough  Selected Excerpts  “From an epidemiology perspective for causality, we apply what’s called “The Bradford Hill” criteria. And they go as follows…  “The first question we’d ask is “does the vaccine have a mechanism of action, a biological mechanism of action, that can actually kill a human being?”  And the answer is yes!    “Because the vaccines all use genetic mechanisms to trick the body into making the lethal spike protein of the virus. It is very conceivable that some people take up too much messenger RNA.  They produce a lethal spike protein in insensitive organs like the brain or the heart or elsewhere. The spike protein damages blood vessels, damages organs, causes blood clots. So it’s well within the mechanism of action that the vaccine could be fatal. Someone could have a fatal blood clot.  They could have fatal myocarditis. The FDA has official warnings of myocarditis. They have warnings on blood clots. They have warnings on a fatal neurologic condition in some cases …. So the FDA warnings, the mechanism of action, clearly say it’s possible. That’s one of the first criteria.  “The second criteria is, “is it a large effect?” And the answer is yes!  This is not a subtle thing. It’s not 151 vs 149 deaths. This is 15,000 deaths. So it’s a very large what’s considered “effect size” or a large effect.  “The third one is “is it internally consistent?” Are you seeing other things that could potentially be fatal in VAERS? Yes! We’re seeing heart attacks.  We’re seeing strokes. We’re seeing myocarditis. We’re seeing blood clots, and what have you. So, it’s internally consistent.  “Is it externally consistent? That’s the next criteria. Well, if you look in the MHRA, the yellow card system in England, the exact same thing has been found! In the Uterus system in the UK the exact same thing’s been found.  “So we have actually fulfilled all of the Bradford Hill criteria! I’ll tell you right now that COVID-19 vaccine is from an epidemiological perspective are causing these deaths in a large fraction!” Dr. Peter McCullough  ***  Dr. McCullough was interviewed by Michael Welch.    Selected Excerpts from Transcript of Interview  “There is zero tolerance for electively taking a drug or a new vaccine and then dying!  There’s zero tolerance for that. People don’t weigh it out and say, “Oh well, I’ll take my chances and die!”  “And I can tell you, the word got out about vaccines causing death in early April, and by mid-April the vaccine rates in the United States plummeted! They absolutely plummeted!  “We hadn’t gotten anywhere near our goals. Remember, President Biden set a goal by July 1. We never got there, because Americans were frightened of their relatives, people in their churches, and their schools dying after the vaccine.  They had heard about it, they saw it. There was an informal internet survey done where, several months ago, there was 12 percent of Americans knew somebody, who knew somebody in their circle who had died after the vaccine.  “I’m a doctor. I’m an internist and cardiologist. I just came from the hospital. In my practice, where I see patients a few days a week in the office, and I’m in the hospital and I do academic work.  I’ve had a woman die of the COVID-19 vaccine! And it was explosive!  She had shot number one. She had shot number two. After shot number two, she developed blood clots throughout her body. She required hospitalization.  She required intravenous blood thinners. She was ravaged. She had neurologic damage.  She finished after that hospitalization in a walker. She came to my office. I checked for more blood clots. I found more blood clots. I put her back on blood thinners. I saw her back about a month later. She seemed like she was a little better. Family was really concerned.  “The next month I get called by the Dallas Coroner office saying she’s found dead at home.”  * * * * *  “The CDC and FDA are running the program. They are NOT the people who typically run vaccine programs! The drug companies run vaccine programs. So when Pfizer, Moderna, J&J ran their randomized trials, we didn’t have any problems! They had good safety oversight! They had data safety monitoring boards. The did okay! I mean I have to give the drug companies an okay.  “But the drug companies are now just the suppliers of the vaccine! Our government agencies are now just running the program. There’s no external advisory committee! There’s no data safety monitoring board! There’s no human ethics committee! NO ONE IS WATCHING OUT FOR THIS!  “And so, the CDC and FDA pretty clearly have their marching orders. Execute this program. That the vaccine is safe and effective. They’re giving NO REPORTS to Americans. No safety reports. We needed those once a month. They haven’t told doctors which is the best vaccine. Which is the safest vaccine. They haven’t told us what groups are to watch out for. How to we mitigate risks. Maybe there’s drug interactions. Maybe it’s people with prior blood clotting problems or diabetes.  “They’re not telling us anything! They literally are blindsiding us, and with no transparency, and now Americans are scared to death! You can feel the tension in America. People are walking off the job! They don’t want to lose their jobs! But they don’t want to die of the vaccine!  “It’s very clear! They say, “listen, I don’t want to die! That’s the reason I’m not taking the vaccine!” It’s just that clear!”  * * * * *  “Most of us don’t have any problem with vaccines! Ninety eight percent of Americans take all the vaccines. I just took a vaccine two weeks ago for the flu. I know I’m not going to die of the flu vaccine. I take it. It’s partially effective. I think that most people who are still susceptible take a COVID vaccine if they knew they weren’t going to die of it or be injured. And because of these giant safety concerns, and the lack of transparency, we’re at an impasse.  “We’ve got a very labour constrained market. We’ve got people walking off the job. We’ve got planes that aren’t going to fly. And it’s all because our agencies are not being transparent and honest with America about vaccine safety.”  * * * * *  “No doctor should be considered a renegade when they order a FDA EU-Approved monoclonal antibody! The monoclonal antibodies are just as approved as the vaccines!  “I just had a patient over the weekend, fully vaccinated, took the booster.  A month after the booster she went on a trip to Dubai, she just came back, she got COVID-19! And she’s had prior bypass surgery. That was yesterday, on a Sunday, she notified me. I got a monoclonal antibody infusion that day. And then today she started the sequence of drugs. Well, they call sequence multi-drug therapy for COVID-19. I am telling you, she is going to get through this illness in a few days. She will not be hospitalized. She will not die!  “You know a podcaster, Joe Rogan, just went through this. Governor Abbott was also a vaccine failure. He went through it. Former President Trump went through it. Americans should see the use of monoclonal antibodies in high risk patients, followed by drugs in an oral sequenced approach, this is standard of care. It is supported by the Association of physicians and Surgeons, The Truth for Health Foundation, the American Front Line Doctors, and the Front Line Critical Care Consortium. This is not renegade medicine! This is what patients should have! This is the correct thing!  “To this day, the patients who get hospitalized, are largely those who receive no early care at home. They’re either denied care or they don’t know about it, and they end up dying.. The vast majority of people who die, die in the hospital, they don’t die at home. And the reason they end up in the hospital, it’s typically two weeks of lack of treatment, and you can’t let a fatal illness brew for two weeks at home with no treatment, and then start treatment very late in the hospital. It’s not going to work.  “I’m telling you, there’s been a very good set of analyses , one in the Journal of Clinical Infectious Disease, that’s the journal for the international infectious disease site of American site of infectious disease, and that showed day by day one loses the opportunity of reducing the hospitalization when the amount of monoclonal antibodies are delayed.  “So, I can tell you my patient this week is going to have a perfect outcome. On the way home from the hospital, I got notified by two more patients -one is six days into it, the woman’s eleven days into it – now they’re younger, but you know she’s still got a fever, of 102F on day 11. I can tell you, the virus is ripping her body right now! And that’s where the monoclonal  antibodies come in. If we can’t get the monoclonal antibodies, we certainly use Hydroxchloroquine, supported by over 250 studies, ivermectin, supported by over 60 studies, combine it with azithromycin or doxycyclene. …  “I’m telling you, doctors should be taking this illness very seriously. We’ve had over 700,000 Americans die with inadequate treatment, and fortunately we have enough doctors now and enough patient awareness, particular patients who listen to your podcasts and your videos to understand that early treatment is viable, it’s necessary, and it should be executed!”																
128	0	We have to stop blindly trusting our trusted authorities that they are giving us good information. It isn’t warranted. We should always insist on hearing both sides of the story.  We should be extremely suspicious when not a single leading medical advocate of the vaccine is willing to debate a team of qualified scientists who disagree with the narrative.  For example, it is well known that Merck received approval from the FDA to give Vioxx to 2 year old children just 3 weeks before Merck pulled the drug for safety issues.  We’re doing it again now with our kids and this time the drug companies aren’t going to pull it even though there is compelling evidence is in plain sight of everyone.  Here are three pieces of unassailable proof that the COVID vaccines are the most dangerous in history and should be immediately pulled:  The VAERS data shows 8,456 deaths in the US. Even using the most conservative assumptions of 223 background deaths (the highest annual death toll in VAERS history), this is 8,233 “excess” deaths. Something caused those deaths. That’s a HUGE number. It’s a public health disaster. If it wasn’t the vaccine, then what did the CDC find caused all these excess deaths? Nothing! Absolutely nothing! Note that I didn’t even have to multiply by the VAERS under-reporting factor (URF) of 41 (calculated via the CDC’s own methodology). There are only 226M vaccinated people. That’s a death rate from the vaccine of at least 36 deaths per million vaccinated (assuming the most conservative possible URF of 1). That’s 36 times more deadly than the deadliest vaccine in human history, a vaccine that is too unsafe to use. It has no business being on the market. Note that all reports in VAERS are validated by HHS before they are allowed to appear in VAERS. Mistakes do happen. There are at least 2 records of the 1.6M in VAERS that were gamed, one by Dr. David Gorski (who is proud of breaking Federal law to do that). A prominent group of neurologists with 20,000 patients has had around 2,000 patients with vaccine-related adverse reactions. In the 11 year history of the practice, they’ve never had a patient with a vaccine-related adverse reaction. While this could happen just by bad luck, the chance of it happening by “bad luck” is less than 1 in 10**100, i.e., impossible. This is a huge increase in significant neurological events that is inexplicable if the vaccines are safe. This is further evidence that the increase in the events reported in VAERS is not “stimulated reporting.” NOTE: The doctors won’t come forward publicly for fear of retribution (loss of medical license). That’s why nobody knows. With the doctors’ permission, I’m happy to disclose it to the NY Times or other reputable news source under NDA if they want to do a story on it. And then there is the 60-fold increase in the rates of adverse events happening in front of our eyes. Hard to explain since it never happened before the vaccines rolled out. When I say unassailable, I mean that nobody can argue using evidence that these happened due to something other than the vaccine as the primary cause. The “using evidence” is key. People make hand-waving arguments all the time to dispute hypotheses. What matters is arguments with supporting evidence. That appears to be non-existent in all three cases.  Extra credit And then I got this which matches what I’ve heard from others. It’s a bit hard to explain if the vaccines are safe. Check with your own neurologist if you don’t believe me.

analysis based on conservative bestcase scenarios the covid shots have killed five times more seniors (65+) than the infection data show higher vaccination rates do not translate into lower covid19 case rates the covid shots are an epic failure the us centers for disease control and prevention reports having more than 30000 spontaneous reports of either hospitalizations and/or deaths among the fully vaccinated data from the centers for medicare & medicaid services show 300000 vaccinated cms recipients have been hospitalized with breakthrough infections 60% of seniors over age 65 hospitalized for covid19 have been vaccinated writes dr joseph mercola osteopathic physician bestselling author and recipient of multiple awards in the field of natural health 50% of reported deaths after covid19 vaccination occur within 24 hours 80% occur within the first week according to one report 86% of deaths have no other explanation aside from a vaccine adverse event a scandinavian study concluded about 40% of postjab deaths among seniors in assisted living homes are directly due to the injection in younger people and children the risk associated with the covid shot compared to the risk of covid19 is bound to be even more pronounced covid vaccines are epic failure herland report subscribe to newsletter covid vaccines are epic failure the level of censorship in social media and search engines is alltime high do like thousands of others subscribe to the herland report newsletter here thanks so much for reading and supporting our investigative work follow the new trends and subscribe to the herland report news site it is a great place to watch interviews/read articles from leading intellectuals thought leaders from across the political spectrum covid vaccines are epic failure october 26 2021 global research published an interview with dr peter mccullough in which he reviews and explains the findings of a september 2021 study published in the journal toxicology reports which states1 a novel bestcase scenario costbenefit analysis showed very conservatively that there are five times the number of deaths attributable to each inoculation vs those attributable to covid19 in the most vulnerable 65+ demographic the risk of death from covid19 decreases drastically as age decreases and the longerterm effects of the inoculations on lower age groups will increase their riskbenefit ratio perhaps substantially mccullough has impeccable academic credentials hes an internist cardiologist epidemiologist and a full professor of medicine at texas a&m college of medicine in dallas he also has a masters degree in public health and is known for being one of the top five mostpublished medical researchers in the united states in addition to being the editor of two medical journals authors defend their paper covid vaccines are epic failure not surprisingly the toxicology reports paper has received scathing critique from certain quarters still corresponding author ronald kostoff told retraction watch that the criticism has actually been an extremely small fraction of the overall response which by and large has been overwhelmingly positive and supportive kostoff went on to say2 an eloquent charismatic and knowledgeable critique of a corrupt systemrobert f kennedy jr from the foreword buy it here a usa today wall street journal and publishers weekly national bestseller given the blatant censorship of the mainstream media and social media only one side of the covid19 vaccine narrative is reaching the public any questioning of the narrative is met with the harshest response  i went into this with my eyes wide open determined to identify the truth irrespective of where it fell i could not stand idly by while the least vulnerable to serious covid19 consequences were injected with substances of unknown mid and longterm safety we published a bestcase scenario the realworld situation is far worse than our bestcase scenario and could be the subject of a future paper what these results show is that we 1) instituted mass inoculations of an inadequatelytested toxic substance with 2) nonnegligible attendant crippling and lethal results to 3) potentially prevent a relatively small number of true covid19 deaths in other words we used a howitzer where an accurate rifle would have sufficed covid jab campaign has had no discernible impact certainly data very clearly show the mass vaccination campaign has not had a discernible impact on global death rates on the contrary in some cases the death toll shot up after the covid shots became widely available you can browse through covid19healthdataorg3 to see this for yourself several examples are also included at the very beginning of the video this trend has also been confirmed in a september 2021 study4 published in the european journal of epidemiology it found covid19 case rates are completely unrelated to vaccination rates related articles double jabbed die rate is six times higher than unvaccinated new data finds licensed pfizer jab comirnaty not available no liability for current emergency use products corporate power who owns the world cancel culture in russia it created a communist holocaust  wnd state power and totalitarianism why selfrighteousness is a danger covid vaccines are epic failure using data available as of september 3 2021 from our world in data for crosscountry analysis and the white house covid19 team data for us counties the researchers investigated the relationship between new covid19 cases and the percentage of the population that had been fully vaccinated sixtyeight countries were included inclusion criteria included second dose vaccine data covid19 case data and population data as of september 3 2021 they then computed the covid19 cases per 1 million people for each country and calculated the percentage of population that was fully vaccinated according to the authors there was no discernable relationship between percentage of population fully vaccinated and new covid19 cases in the last seven days if anything higher vaccination rates were associated with a slight increase in cases according to the authors5 [t]he trend line suggests a marginally positive association such that countries with higher percentage of population fully vaccinated have higher covid19 cases per 1 million people the kostoff analysis covid vaccines are epic failure getting back to the toxicology reports paper6 which is being referring to as the kostoff analysis mccullough says the analysis is definitely making news in clinical medicine the paper focuses on two factors assumptions and determinism determinism describes how likely something is for example if a person takes a covid shot its 100% certain they got the injection its not 50% or 75% its an absolute certainty as a result that person has a 100% chance of being exposed to whatever risk is associated with that shot on the other hand if a person says no to the injection its not 100% chance theyll get covid19 let alone die from it you have a less than 1% chance of being exposed to sarscov2 and getting sick so its 100% deterministic that taking the shot exposes you to the risks of the shot and less than 1% deterministic that youll get covid if you dont take the shot the other part of the equation is the assumptions which are based on calculations using available data such as precovid death statistics and death reports filed with the us vaccine adverse event reports system (vaers) mortality data as noted by mccullough two reports have detailed covid jab death data showing 50% of deaths occur within 24 hours and 80% occur within the first week in one of these reports 86% of deaths were found to have no other explanation aside from a vaccine adverse event mccullough also cites a scandinavian study that concluded about 40% of postjab deaths among seniors in assisted living homes are directly due to the injection he also cites other eyeopening figures the us center for disease control and prevention reports having more than 30000 spontaneous reports of either hospitalizations and/or deaths among the fully vaccinated data from the centers for medicare & medicaid services show 300000 vaccinated cms recipients have been hospitalized with breakthrough infections 60% of seniors over age 65 hospitalized for covid19 have been vaccinated covid shots are failing wholesale covid vaccines are epic failure when we put all these data together we have clearcut science that the vaccines are failing wholesale mccullough says the shots are particularly useless in seniors again based on a bestcase conservative scenario seniors are five times more likely to die from the shot than they are from the natural infection this scenario includes the assumption that the pcr test is accurate and reported covid deaths were in fact due to covid19 which we know is not the case and the assumption that the shots actually prevent death which we have no proof of all things considered you are far better off taking your chances with the natural infection as mccullough says the kostoff analysis also does not take into account the fact that there are safe and effective treatments it bases its assumptions on the notion that there arent any it also doesnt factor in the fact that the covid shots are utterly ineffective against the delta and other variants if you take into account vaccine failure against variants and alternative treatments it skews the analysis even further toward natural infection being the safest alternative fda and cdc should not run vaccine programs while the us food and drug administration and the cdc claim not a single death following covid inoculation was caused by the shot they should not be the ones making that determination as they are both sponsoring the vaccination campaign they have an inherent bias when you conduct a trial you would never allow the sponsor to tell you whether the product was the cause of death because you know theyre biased we have actually fulfilled all of the bradford hill criteria ill tell you right now that covid19 vaccine is from an epidemiological perspective causing these deaths or a large fraction ~ dr peter mccullough what we need is an external group a critical event committee to analyze the deaths being reported as well as a data safety monitoring board these should have been in place from the start but were not had they been the program would most likely have been halted in february as by then the number of reported deaths 186 already exceeded the tolerable threshold of about 150 (based on the number of injections given) now were well over 170007 theres no normal circumstance under which that would ever be allowed the cdc and fda are running the [vaccination] program they are not the people who typically run vaccine programs mccullough says the drug companies run vaccine programs when pfizer moderna j&j ran their randomized trials we didnt have any problems they had good safety oversight they had data safety monitoring boards the did ok i mean i have to give the drug companies [credit] but the drug companies are now just the suppliers of the vaccine our government agencies are now just running the program theres no external advisory committee theres no data safety monitoring board theres no human ethics committee no one is watching out for this and so the cdc and fda pretty clearly have their marching orders execute this program the vaccine is safe and effective theyre giving no reports to americans no safety reports we needed those once a month they havent told doctors which is the best vaccine which is the safest vaccine they havent told us what groups are to watch out for how to mitigate risks maybe there are drug interactions maybe its people with prior blood clotting problems or diabetes theyre not telling us anything they literally are blindsiding us and with no transparency and americans now are scared to death you can feel the tension in america people are walking off the job they dont want to lose their jobs but they dont want to die of the vaccine its very clear they say listen i dont want to die thats the reason im not taking the vaccine its just that clear bradford hill criteria are met  covid jabs cause death covid vaccines are epic failure mccullough goes on to explain the bradford hill criterion for causation which is one of the ways by which we can actually determine that yes the shots are indeed killing people were not dealing with coincidence the first question wed ask is does the vaccine have a mechanism of action a biological mechanism of action that can actually kill a human being and the answer is yes because the vaccines all use genetic mechanisms to trick the body into making the lethal spike protein of the virus it is very conceivable that some people take up too much messenger rna they produce a lethal spike protein in sensitive organs like the brain or the heart or elsewhere the spike protein damages blood vessels damages organs causes blood clots so its well within the mechanism of action that the vaccine could be fatal someone could have a fatal blood clot they could have fatal myocarditis the fda has official warnings of myocarditis they have warnings on blood clots they have warnings on a fatal neurologic condition called guillainbarre syndrome so the fda warnings the mechanism of action clearly say its possible the second criteria is is it a large effect and the answer is yes this is not a subtle thing its not 151 versus 149 deaths this is 15000 deaths so its a very large effect size a large effect the third [criteria] is is it internally consistent are you seeing other things that could potentially be fatal in vaers yes were seeing heart attacks were seeing strokes were seeing myocarditis were seeing blood clots and what have you so its internally consistent is it externally consistent thats the next criteria well if you look in the mhra the yellow card system in england the exact same thing has been found in the eudravigilance system in [europe] the exact same things been found so we have actually fulfilled all of the bradford hill criteria ill tell you right now that covid19 vaccine is from an epidemiological perspective causing these deaths or a large fraction zero tolerance for elective drugs causing death covid vaccines are epic failure there may be cases in which a high risk of death from a drug might be acceptable if you have a terminal incurable disease for example you may be willing to experiment and take your chances under normal circumstances however lethal drugs are not tolerated after five suspected deaths a drug will receive a black box warning at 50 deaths it will be removed from the market considering covid19 has a less than 1% risk of death across age groups the tolerance for a deadly remedy is infinitesimal at over 17000 reported deaths which in real numbers may exceed 2120008 the covid shots far surpass any reasonable risk to protect against symptomatic covid19 as noted by mccullough there is zero tolerance for electively taking a drug or a new vaccine and then dying theres zero tolerance for that people dont weigh it out and say oh well ill take my chances and die and i can tell you the word got out about vaccines causing death in early april [2021] and by midapril the vaccination rates in the united states plummeted  we hadnt gotten anywhere near our goals remember president biden set a goal [of 70% vaccination rate] by july 1 we never got there because americans were frightened by their relatives people in their churches and their schools dying after the vaccine they had heard about it they saw it there was an informal internet survey done several months ago where 12% of americans knew somebody who had died after the vaccine im a doctor im an internist and cardiologist i just came from the hospital  i had a woman die of the covid19 vaccine  she had shot no 1 she had shot no 2 after shot no 2 she developed blood clots throughout her body she required hospitalization she required intravenous blood thinners she was ravaged she had neurologic damage after that hospitalization she was in a walker she came to my office i checked for more blood clots i found more blood clots i put her back on blood thinners i saw her about a month later she seemed like she was a little better family was really concerned the next month i got called by the dallas coroner office saying shes found dead at home most of us dont have any problem with vaccines 98% of americans take all the vaccines  i think most people who are still susceptible would take a covid vaccine if they knew they werent going to die of it or be injured and because of these giant safety concerns and the lack of transparency were at an impasse weve got a very laborconstrained market weve got people walking off the job weve got planes that arent going to fly and its all because our agencies are not being transparent and honest with america about vaccine safety early treatment is crucial vaxxed or not covid vaccines are epic failure as noted by mccullough the vast majority of patients require hospitalization for covid19 is because theyve not received any treatment and the infection has been allowed free reign for days on end to this day the patients who get hospitalized are largely those who receive no early care at home he says theyre either denied care or they dont know about it and they end up dying the vast majority of people who die die in the hospital they dont die at home and the reason why they end up in the hospital its typically two weeks of lack of treatment you cant let a fatal illness brew for two weeks at home with no treatment and then start treatment very late in the hospital its not going to work theres been a very good set of analyses one in the journal of clinical infectious diseases  that showed day by day one loses the opportunity of reducing the hospitalization when monoclonal antibodies are delayed  no doctor should be considered a renegade when they order fda [emergency use authorized] monoclonal antibody the monoclonal antibodies are just as approved as the vaccines i just had a patient over the weekend fully vaccinated took the booster a month after the booster she went on a trip to dubai she just came back and she got covid19  i got her a monoclonal antibody infusion that day [the following day] she started the sequence of multidrug therapy for covid19 i am telling you she is going to get through this illness in a few days  podcaster joe rogan just went through this governor abbott was also a vaccine failure he went through it former president trump went through it americans should see the use of monoclonal antibodies in high risk patients followed by drugs in an oral sequenced approach this is standard of care it is supported by the association of physicians and surgeons the truth for health foundation the american front line doctors and the front line critical care consortium this is not renegade medicine this is what patients should have this is the correct thing  if we cant get the monoclonal antibodies we certainly use hydroxychloroquine supported by over 250 studies ivermectin supported by over 60 studies combined with azithromycin or doxycycline inhaled budesonide  fulldose aspirin  nutraceuticals including zinc vitamin d vitamin c quercetin nac  we do oral and nasal decontamination with povidoneiodine in acutely sick patients we do it every four hours [and it] massively reduces the viral load  fortunately we have enough doctors now and enough patient awareness patients who  understand that early treatment is viable is necessary and it should be executed

covid mrna vaccines paul craig roberts a scientific study recently released by british researchers found that for men under forty the risk of myocarditis almost doubled after the first pfizer jab the risk doubled again after the second jab and doubled again after the third jab to eight times the baseline risk for the moderna version the risks were 16 times the baseline risk after the second jab https//alexberensonsubstackcom/p/morebadnewsoncovidvaccinesand/comments why then are there vaccine mandates is this stupidity or a depopulation program this is a legitimate question the adverse effects or sideeffects of the mrna vaccines that are underreported to vaers are not side effects in the traditional sense such as an allergic response to a vaccine or the effect of a substance in a vaccine on a person sensitive to that substance what are being called adverse effects are consequences of the vaccine turning the human immune system into a weapon against its own body as described by dr sucharit bahkdi and others https//wwwpaulcraigrobertsorg/2022/01/05/videodrsucharitbhakdithesevaccinesarekillingtheyoungandtheoldtheyarekillingourchildren/ what is said to be an immunogen is in fact a pathogen engineered to be distributed throughout the body and to attack heart lungs brain ovaries and all vital organs disabilities and deaths result there are valid reasons to suspect that both the virus and the vaccine are engineered pathogens one is that both were under development for a long time another reason is that in order to generate a high level of fear to prepare people to line up for the protection of the vaccine treatment was withheld in order to maximize the death rate and known cures such as hcq and ivermectin were demonized and banned from use and now the evil biden regime has seized control of a third treatmentmonoclonal antibodiesand is withholding them from patients https//wwwrealclearpoliticscom/video/2022/01/03/desantis_biden_admin_has_seized_control_of_monoclonal_antibodies_not_distributing_it_the_way_it_should_behtml the reason for withholding cures is to drive up the vaccination rate another reason the pandemic is suspect is that all independent discussion and evidence is suppressed by the corrupt media and medical establishment the narrative is controlled and vaccination is presented as the only alternative even though it is now admitted that the vaccine is ineffective against covid19 and its variants the current rationale for the vaccine was expressed the other day by the incompetent secretary of defense who triplevaxxed still caught covid and explained that the jabs protected him against having a more serious case so we have a vaccine that doesnt work against mild cases of the virus but does work against serious cases just how does that work the medical and scientific evidence is completely clear that the entire covid narrative is counterfactual and that the authorities know it yet they still push using coercion for more vaccination vaccination does not protect it harms so the only reason to enforce it is to kill people the inability of people to distrust authorities and the inability of people to inform themselves and to think for themselves guarantees that millions will die from being vaccinated when you see thousands of independent doctors and medical scientists damning the vaccine only to be ignored by bureaucratic public health organizations you have clear evidence that real authority is not speaking it is being suppressed anytime debate and information is suppressed you know that something is being hidden and that a secret agenda is operating the orchestrated covid pandemic is a massive crime against humanity are we going to allow them to get away with it or will there be too few of us left to do anything about it addendum an expert pointed out to me that clearly medical authorities do not mind if the vaccine is killing people and the deaths are consistent with the bill gates/world economic forum intent to reduce the world population however an intermediate goal is to transition to the vaccine passport as in germany austria italy greece and with france belgium and the netherlands about to join in the requirement of a digital id that allows tracking of everyone and every interaction and thereby control of the population with rewards and punishments like the chinese social credit system this allows the controlled populations to be scapegoated for the mayhem caused by depopulation this is a reasonable explanation for the emphasis on covid passports as it is known and admitted that the vaccine is inefficient as a protection against the virus and as the virus is dangerous mainly to untreated patients with comorbidities the passport is pointless for any purpose other than control the passport provides no protection whatsoever against the spread of the virus and the immune systems attack on the bodys vital organs																
131	0	The us vaers system records reports of vaccine injuries and deaths due to vaccines it has been well documented that the database only contains 1% to 10% of the true numbers for various reasons in other words the real numbers may be 10x to 100x the numbers in the database currently it shows 46 children killed by pfizer covid vaccine shots in the usa it has been documented that the people who maintain that database have carried out campaigns of removing records that people added several researchers discovered the deletions by taking multiple daily snapshots and discovering missing records days or weeks later the reasons include that many people including (surprisingly) doctors dont know it exists or maybe they dont care enough it is also difficult to navigate through the typical government website that appears designed to be hard to use and then there is the time it takes to fill in a report whatever it is doesnt matter right now what is important is that at least 46 kids who

132	0	A scientific study recently released by british researchers found that for men under forty the risk of myocarditis almost doubled after the first pfizer jab the risk doubled again after the second jab and doubled again after the third jab to eight times the baseline risk for the moderna version the risks were 16 times the baseline risk after the second jab why then are there vaccine mandates is this stupidity or a depopulation program this is a legitimate question the adverse effects or sideeffects of the mrna vaccines that are underreported to vaers are not side effects in the traditional sense such as an allergic response to a vaccine or the effect of a substance in a vaccine on a person sensitive to that substance what are being called adverse effects are consequences of the vaccine turning the human immune system into a weapon against its own body as described by dr sucharit bahkdi and others what is said to be an immunogen is in fact a pathogen engineered to be distributed throughout the body and to attack heart lungs brain ovaries and all vital organs disabilities and deaths result there are valid reasons to suspect that both the virus and the vaccine are engineered pathogens one is that both were under development for a long time another reason is that in order to generate a high level of fear to prepare people to line up for the protection of the vaccine treatment was withheld in order to maximize the death rate and known cures such as hcq and ivermectin were demonized and banned from use and now the evil biden regime has seized control of a third treatmentmonoclonal antibodiesand is withholding them from patients the reason for withholding cures is to drive up the vaccination rate another reason the pandemic is suspect is that all independent discussion and evidence is suppressed by the corrupt media and medical establishment the narrative is controlled and vaccination is presented as the only alternative even though it is now admitted that the vaccine is ineffective against covid19 and its variants the current rationale for the vaccine was expressed the other day by the incompetent secretary of defense who triplevaxxed still caught covid and explained that the jabs protected him against having a more serious case so we have a vaccine that doesnt work against mild cases of the virus but does work against serious cases just how does that work the medical and scientific evidence is completely clear that the entire covid narrative is counterfactual and that the authorities know it yet they still push using coercion for more vaccination vaccination does not protect it harms so the only reason to enforce it is to kill people the inability of people to distrust authorities and the inability of people to inform themselves and to think for themselves guarantees that millions will die from being vaccinated when you see thousands of independent doctors and medical scientists damning the vaccine only to be ignored by bureaucratic public health organizations you have clear evidence that real authority is not speaking it is being suppressed anytime debate and information is suppressed you know that something is being hidden and that a secret agenda is operating the orchestrated covid pandemic is a massive crime against humanity are we going to allow them to get away with it or will there be too few of us left to do anything about it addendum an expert pointed out to me that clearly medical authorities do not mind if the vaccine is killing people and the deaths are consistent with the bill gates/world economic forum intent to reduce the world population however an intermediate goal is to transition to the vaccine passport as in germany austria italy greece and with france belgium and the netherlands about to join in the requirement of a digital id that allows tracking of everyone and every interaction and thereby control of the population with rewards and punishments like the chinese social credit system this allows the controlled populations to be scapegoated for the mayhem caused by depopulation this is a reasonable explanation for the emphasis on covid passports as it is known and admitted that the vaccine is inefficient as a protection against the virus and as the virus is dangerous mainly to untreated patients with comorbidities the passport is pointless for any purpose other than control the passport provides no protection whatsoever against the spread of the virus and the immune systems attack on the bodys vital organs addendum an expert pointed out to me

133	0	Masks and covid tests contain nanotech vaccines without informed consent by dr ariyana love killer injections people nationwide are being coerced and forced to suffocate themselves and their children in mandated masks theyre being forced to take covid19 tests in order to fly and experimental mrna and adenovirus injections which are being falsely labeled as vaccines the covid vaccines are not vaccines at all but a form of gene therapy with a nanotech delivery system which in other words is genetic engineering nobody is allowed to administer experimental drugs into your body without your informed consent according to an internal study by health human services and harvard less than 1% of vaccine side effects are reported to government vaccine injury reporting systems this means the actual deaths in europe from the experimental covid injections are about 99% higher than whats being reported it means the actual deaths are closer to 453024 that should drop your jaw where is the surveillance and oversight of these experimental geneediting technologies that are being injected into your bodies and your childrens bodies shouldnt they be monitored and shouldnt the actual deaths and adverse reactions be reported obviously big pharma and corporate mainstream media is hiding something from us a freedom of information (foi) request published to the daily expose in march showed 2207 deaths within 28 days of having the experimental covid injections during the month of february in scotland this means the actual unreported deaths are about 218493 in scotland alone people are being widely deceived and bribed to acquiesce to their own deaths masks and covid tests also contain bioweapons in march of 2020 coronavirus test kits heading to the uk were found contaminated with coronavirus the cdcs covid test kits sent out across the us in february 2020 were also caught contaminated with coronavirus after president trump initiated a federal investigation egyptian slave punishment covid test deaths an austrian court just ruled the pcr test not suitable for determining infectivity and rejects the entire corona policy in austria which is based on this very test there are many suppressed reports of cognitive impairment sickness and sudden deaths after the nasopharyngeal swab otherwise known as the pcr (polymerase chain reaction) after being covid tested these symptoms are reported headaches nausea vomiting and clear watery drainage from the side of the nose also known as a cerebrospinal fluid leak cerebrospinal fluid leaks results from head trauma or injury to the spine hochkrebseregendes ethylenoxid an pcr teststabchen the nasopharyngeal swab sample is being taken from an extremely delicate area right at the blood/brain barrier this medical procedure is a violent and invasive exploitation of your basic rights to choose whats delivered into your body hydrogel nanotechnology hydrogels infused with nanoparticles are being used in a number of biological applications tissue engineering chemical and biological sensing and drug and gene delivery unfortunately these nanobots are not being used to heal us as they could be instead theyve been programmed for destruction black worms or parasitelooking nanotubes have been found in masks and covid tests around the world embedded in the tiny fibers they cannot be seen by the naked eye but when held under a microscope they are visible nanotubes are motionless until activated by heat and moisture and then they wiggle just like a parasite see more videos here the discovery of hydrogel nanotechnology in masks and covid tests can mean only one thing what we are seeing in the video above are carbon nanotubes for vaccine delivery carbon nanotubes were designed as an antigen delivery system in vitro and in vivo covid vaccines masks and tests are not being administered for your protection these are experimental medical devices programmed to penetrate your cells and deliver a deadly payload directly into your cells for genetic engineering a groundbreaking new study revealed that experimental nanotech medical devices are already being used in 43 leading vaccines nanotech has long been fed to us in our foods its labeled as a vitamin and mineral supplement and is disguised in other ways despite that its known to cause leaky gut syndrome and autoimmune disease carbon nanotubes in april health canada warned of microscopic graphene particles used in masks which cause early pulmonary toxicity in other words theyre causing severe lung damage graphenebased materials kill bacteria and thats the selling point but when used in face masks its comparable to breathing in asbestos all day long says health canada graphene was designed as a drug and vaccine carrier graphene is used for dna sequencing and manipulation so why are graphene nanotubes also being found in nappies (diapers) and womans sanitary pads according to reports following ingestion and inhalation graphene carrying nanobots easily cross the bloodbrain barrier theyre proven to be toxic to human tissue and cell cultures resulting in oxidative stress inflammatory cytokine production and dna mutation they are also being programmed to cause cell death nanosilver is being marketed in masks as a positive thing because its a strong antimicrobial which means it kills bacteria and fungi companies capitalizing on face masks are making unsubstantiated public health claims however saying their masks provide protection against covid19 in actuality these products are infecting you with programmed nanobots and experimental drugs nano masks are also being marketed to kids for stealth delivery nano masks for kids neither the epa nor the fda has approved nanosilver for use in face coverings or masks and the epa already qualifies nanosilver as a pesticide in addition nanosilver in face masks is an environmental biohazard billions of masks have been discarded into the environment already nanosilver is infused into nanotubes which are semiconductors for ballistic transport of a drug payload the graphene nanotubes are 3d polymeric networks of nanocomposite hydrogel hydrogels are a controlled drug delivery system with a number of biological applications having to do with bioengineering including tissue engineering chemical and biological sensing and drug and gene delivery originally nanotube technology was developed as dna altering gene therapy to be used to treat cancer now nanotubes are being used in an array of products including masks and covid tests without informed consent here are some videos about nanotubes for additional study nanotubes are activated and mobilized by thermal heat having a polymer shell structure the graphene hydrogel nanotubes were designed with the purpose of carrying the nanosilver with a drug payload for vaccine delivery nanotubes were also developed for vaccine delivery in europe the elastomeric nature of this material allows the hydrogels and nanotubes to obtain various shapes and sizes and to shrink and expand carbon nanotubes  link here the presence of silver ions stop the respiratory enzyme from transferring electrons to oxygen molecules during respiration in other words the presence of carbon nanotubes and nanosilver in masks means there is a drug payload that is severing your cells ability to receive oxygen at the same time the nanosilver nanobots are also programmed to pass through the cell membrane of lung cells destroying them the nanosilver in covid tests targets brain cells and potentially other parts of the body carbon nanotubes in fibrous looking hydrogel (masks) the boasted antibacterial applications of nanosilver for masks are clearly a cover when coupled with statements like silver nanoparticles need to be small enough to pass through the cell membrane if nanosilver were actually being used for antibacterial applications then why do they need to pass through the cell membranes of mask wearers nanotubes are activated by heat and by apparent moisture they are semiconductors so they can be programmed to activate by energy frequency our bodies are literally batteries and our exhale is filled with moisture nanotube size the nanosilver nanobots are programmed to disconnect from the nanotube and reassemble in your body to target locations like the brain gut or lung cells in laboratories hydrogels are created in various shapes and sizes they can swell and shrink and are activated using lasers there was recently a toxic mask recall in quebec because of lung damage in children due to maskwearing in daycares meanwhile a mysterious new brain disease has appeared in canada which causes spasms memory loss and hallucinations and has doctors baffled people are beginning to catch on that nanomasks and covid tests are delivering shots of nanobots to the brain various masks for comparison most rna vaccines are nasally administered in fact finland is currently developing its own experimental adenovirus nasal vaccine given that this is a transfection of foreign rna into human cells it too constitutes an illegal medical experiment the health ranger from natural news talks about lipid nanoparticles in the mrna vaccines which is causing massive inflammation due to the adjuvants these nanosized robots are programmed to destroy your innate immune system former fema employee turned whistleblower celeste solum has revealed something new and shocking from us government documents the covid tests insert a magnetic beacon which allows for tracking the covid test kit patent is owned and operated by richard a rothschild which is patent #us2020279585(a1) celeste solum covid test inserts microchip dna harvesting bill evanina stepped down as a top counterintelligence official in the us government in january 2021 to authorize a rare and urgent public warning foreign powers can collect store and exploit biometric information from covid tests there is evidence that the nasopharyngeal swab for the covid test is being used to harvest dna by the chinese communist party (ccp) and bill gates 60 minutes did an expose on the bgi groups use of covid tests to collect store and exploit the biometric information of american citizens the obama administration opened the door for the ccp and allowed bgi group a foothold in the us what do they want our dna for unapproved deadly poisons aside from nanotech medical devices and forced genetic engineering scientists have found evidence of a chemical cocktail in face masks of the most heavily restricted poisons regulated by authorities in europe and the usa experts say masks are comparable to breathing hazardous waste quite honestly i think mainstream media is focusing on mask toxicity in order to divert our attention away from nanotech bioengineering masks breathing in toxic waste outlined in this article are 20 reasons mandatory face masks are unsafe ineffective and immoral ethylene oxide most masks and face coverings (including cloth) are made with toxic and carcinogenic chemicals including fire retardant fibreglass lead nfe phthalates ethylene oxide polyfluorinated chemicals and formaldehyde we are being told that the covid test and masks are for our safety but masks and covid tests are sprayed with ethylene oxide we are told this is to sterilize the product but it also sterilizes the user the epa classifies ethylene oxide as an extremely hazardous toxic chemical the washington state department of labor & industries issued an urgent medical warning in april 2020 stating this extremely hazardous toxic chemical poses a severe risk to human health ethylene oxide has never been approved by the us governments osha for use on personal protective equipment so why is it being used on face masks and inserted to peoples blood/brain barrier according to the epa and the cdc ethylene oxide is a carcinogen and the most cancerouscausing substance known to man it has been linked to neurologic dysfunction and may cause other harmful effects to the eyes lungs brain and nervous system ethylene oxide is a flammable gas that dissolves easily in water thus covering your mouth with it is not smart in fact evidence reveals that using ethylene oxide on masks results in offgassing in the wearers breathing zone prolonged exposure causes neurologic dysfunction and nervous system depression even more horrifying is that ethylene oxide is mutagenic in humans which means it has the power to permanently alter your genes and damage your dna its also teragenetic which means it causes birth defects in your babies oh and its a key ingredient in antifreeze i have to wonder if the offgasing of mask wearers will endanger nonmask wearers phthalates a recent research study showed that nonreusable masks contain a powerful plastic chemical called phthalate it softens plastic products and triggers extreme reproductive damages in men while also damaging dna overexposure to phthalates decreases fertility and causes penises to shrink it also induces male gametes mutations leading to increased preand postnatal mortality of offspring that just cant be good prion disease deborah tavares on israeli news live reveals from leaked us government documents that the covid vaccines cause prion disease thats an irreversible autoimmune disease conclusion masks and covid tests are instruments of war they are part of a deadly medical experiment for genetic engineering and depopulation these are not masks vaccines or tests at all they are experimental medical devices ridden with deadly poisons which sterilize permanently and irreversibly alter dna masks and covid tests also contain the experimental covid geneediting bioweapons with a poisonous payload inside a nanotech delivery system these are weapons of war being used to enslave and reduce the population in a deadly medical experiment which is in contravention of nuremberg codes and violates informed consent laws quit damaging your blood/brain barrier with fake tests quit giving them your dna quit wearing masks dont put them on your kids use cloth diapers and organic sanitary pads be smart whatever you do dont take the covid injections because that means game over they are an irreversible oneshot kill shot the nanotech bioweapons vaccines means guaranteed death it might not kill you right away but the destruction to your cells and immune system will be ongoing until death thats what autoimmune disease is watch dr naomi wolf discuss why vaccine passports mean slavery forever here are ways of detoxifying your body from nanoparticles please watch the below video and study the material and links within this article be informed whats being done to us is against free will inalienable rights

https//childrenshealthdefenseorg/defender/kristidobbsinjuredpfizercovidvaccinelocalnewsagencykillsstory/ link copied kristi dobbs a 40yearold dental hygienist from missouri said she can no longer work after being injured by pfizers covid vaccine miss a day miss a lot subscribe to the defenders top news of the day its free kristi dobbs a 40yearold dental hygienist from missouri said she can no longer work after being injured by pfizers covid vaccine she has spent the past nine months pleading with us health agencies to research the neurological injuries she and others are experiencing in hopes of finding a treatment since getting the vaccine dobbs has seen 16 different medical providers shes been on 22 different medications to address more than 20 different symptoms  none of which she had prior to getting the vaccine dobbs said she and others who developed neurological injuries after getting a covid vaccine shared their experiences with a reporter in hope of raising awareness about their experiences but the story never ran because according to the reporter a higher up at pfizer pressured the news agency to drop it dobbs got her first and only dose of pfizers vaccine on jan 18 she immediately experienced an adverse reaction onsite at the hospital clinic where her vaccine was administered 1 million copies sold  the real anthony fauci  the book that launched a movement buy today i had barely sat down in the monitoring area after the inoculation and felt an odd tingling sensation running down my left arm where i had just received the jab dobbs wrote i immediately had a presyncope episode where i thought i was going to pass out heart palpitations increased pulse increased respirations and a blood pressure spike that was within a strokeworthy reading dobbs was monitored for an additional 45 minutes when her blood pressure dropped to a manageable range she was released dobbs said the people monitoring her brushed off her symptoms as a panic attack or hot flash but she had never been afraid of vaccines blood draws or needles i gave injections in the mouth as a hygienist so it was no big deal to me dobbs said three days later dobbs woke up in the middle of the night and thought her whole bed was shaking but her husband said he didnt feel it she also noticed shaking and trembling in her left hand but thought maybe it was due to having coffee the next day dobbs felt a stabbing pain in her left scapula and shaking and trembling sensations in both hands as each day progressed her symptoms worsened by day 10 i was in excruciating pain dobbs said on jan 28 dobbs went to a chiropractor in st louis to see what was causing the stabbing pain in her scapula and the radiating pain and tremors in both arms the chiropractor thought she had a rib out so he adjusted her the next morning dobbs woke up with extreme pain and tremors throughout her entire body dobbs wrote on january 30 im in urgent care with stabbing pain in my left scapula regions full body tremors paresthesias from head to toe swollen lymph nodes tinnitus dizziness headache and an odd internal vibrating sensation urgent care doctor thinks i am having muscle spasms and thinks i am stressed because of my mother in law [who was battling cancer] and traveling so much so he [prescribed] flexeril and medrol dose pack on feb 1 dobbs visited a local chiropractor to see if she could help with the symptoms as they were catching up the chiropractor noticed dobbs tremors body shakes and super high blood pressure dobbs wrote at this point i am having problems regulating my bp and she knows that this is out of character for me she asks me what i have done differently since i saw her last and i cant think of anything except the pfizer vaccine bingo  thats it she says she immediately stops and tells me that i need to get in to see my primary care provider on feb 2 when dobbs saw her primary care provider she had visible tremors and whole body paresthesia [my care provider] had no clue if this could be vaccinerelated but didnt dismiss the fact dobbs said it was too new to tell and she had no knowledge of any reactions the doctor recommended antianxiety medication ran labs did a physical exam and sent her on her way shortly after dobbs experienced issues with heavy legs and trouble walking and getting up stairs to the point she couldnt feel pin pricks on her legs on feb 5 dobbs went to the er because she said she felt like she was dying she said i had fullbody paresthesia internal tremors/vibrations essential tremors in my hands tremors in my arms and legs fatigue brain fog muscle pain and weakness pelvic pain irregular menstrual cycles that included heavy bleeding and thick clotting skin rashes tinnitus temperature regulation issues swollen lymph nodes loss of appetite weight loss dizziness/balance issues blood pressure regulation issues neck pain headaches heart palpitations convulsions or pseudo seizure at night and insomnia like many others who have experienced neurological reactions to covid vaccines dobbs had a ct scan and the results were normal no other tests were performed doctors did not dismiss that this was vaccinerelated but they had no clue what to do or how to treat it if it was dobbs said i was given another antianxiety medication which did nothing for me and was referred to a neurologist in the meantime my vibrations brain fog and other symptoms intensified dobbs saw a neurologist on feb 12 when the nurse practitioner ordered tests an mri and blood work the mri was normal and dobbs was prescribed another medication dobbs began searching for answers on her own she said i was searching for answers on my own and i came across an article in neurology today with a comment at the bottom of the article from a retired gastroenterologist who had been injured by the vaccine and she left her email address that was the day i knew i was not alone in this vaccine injury journey i had found dr danice hertz she was in contact with a few others injured as well dobbs said she and others started a private social media group to collaborate because their local doctors did not know what to do and elite doctors either dont know what to do or were unwilling to help us dobbs said the vaccine injury group grew by 400% in two days and in under a year thousands of injured people had found each other soon we all knew we were not alone yet no one had answers yet she said danice [hertz] emailed doctors every day for help dobbs said and it wasnt until march 9 she got through to dr avindra nath at the national institutes of health (nih) and i was able to call them and get a telehealth appointment with dr farinaz safavi dobbs said safavi was aware of these neurological vaccine reactions  as the nih was already seeing patients for injuries like these  and recommended a whole host of new tests run by my hometown doctor as well as certain procedures she thought could potentially cure me subscribe to the defender  its free name* first name last name email* email adverse reaction on april 19 safavi wrote in an email to dobbs that information regarding these adverse events would be published soon  and hopefully by that time healthcare providers would have a better idea what to do with these sideeffects she said safavi the nih requested blood samples a complete medical release for history and test results that had already been completed i sent all of it dobbs said we had very good conversations for the next several weeks and then by early may  nothing still to date i have heard nothing from them dobbs said supposedly she [dr safavi] called the neurologist but the neurologist said she never called her for recommendations the immunology allergist never received a call either when dobbs reached out to safavi again in may her tune changed its like they went from we know its the vaccine to were trying to figure it out dobbs explained its like as soon as they got what they needed we were just cut off even some of the ladies that went to the nih for treatment  once they were done with treatment with these same doctors  they were essentially cut off when they werent getting better their exact verbiage to us was you need early and swift intervention after a vaccine reaction but here we are months after an adverse reaction and our hometown doctors have no clue what to do safavi in an email to dobbs on may 24 said she believed dobbs was experiencing an immunemediated inflammatory response or some other immunemediated small fiber neuropathy kristi dobbs nih doctor covid vaccine adverse reaction according to alexander chamessian md phd smallfiber neuropathy is a neurological disorder involving widespread damage to the smalldiameter somatic and autonomic unmyelinated cfibers and/or thinly myelinated adelta fibers patients often experience pinsandneedles or burning pain sensations damage to the autonomic small fibers can cause dysfunction in key systems controlling blood pressure heart rate and gastrointestinal motility dobbs has seen more than 16 different medical providers including an allergy immunologist who took blood samples and discovered dobbs had antiphospholipid antibodies  a group of immune proteins (antibodies) the body mistakenly produces against itself in an autoimmune response to phospholipids a dermatologist diagnosed dobbs with granuloma annulare an inflammatory skin condition caused by the immune response her body had which left her with skin lesions dobbs also tested positive for bloodclotting factors had high inflammatory markers and lab values that indicated her immune system was poorly functioning one neurologist believed dobbs was having an immune inflammatory response to pfizers vaccine caused by inflamed nerves dobbs had an ultrasound of her kidneys which showed they were not working properly my kidneys were holding onto water but by the time i saw the urologist a month later the hydronephrosis was clear she said dobbs said no one knows what to do for me or how to treat this vaccine reaction i have really great doctors here at home and as they have all said we dont really know what to do but we can try to treat the symptoms there is no medication or supplement strong enough to ease the pain or control the constant symptoms that plague me 24/7 there is still no acknowledgement from nih cdc [centers for disease control and prevention] fda [us food and drug administration] pharmaceutical companies or any other governmental entity or institute that follows vaccine safety and side effects to date group conducts survey that shows signal concerns dobbs said once they established their facebook group the members knew they needed a better way to convey their ailments so others could easily read and identify them from there we started our own patientlead surveys which gave statistical data that was entered into a spreadsheet dobbs said we then had a top epidemiologist review the information and compared the numbers to previous vaccinations and injuries we were all astonished by the numbers the survey assessed reports of paresthesia following covid vaccination from the cdcs vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) and compared it to reports of paresthesia following 2009 swine flu monovalent as03adjuvanted pandemic vaccine  a vaccine that was associated with disturbances similar to those experienced after covid vaccines according to the nih paresthesia refers to a burning numbness skincrawling or prickling sensation usually felt in the hands arms legs or feet but can also occur in other parts of the body chronic paresthesia is often a symptom of an underlying neurological disease or traumatic nerve damage paresthesia can be caused by disorders affecting the central nervous system for the survey vaers reports of paresthesia following all covid vaccines were collected and the rate of reporting per 100000 vaccinated people was calculated the total vaers reports of paresthesia following covid vaccines as of june 18 were 13559 with 5818 attributed to pfizer 4514 to moderna and 1317 to johnson & johnson the total number of vaccines administered as of june 25 per cdcs covid19 vaccine tracker was 178491147 the vaers rate of paresthesia as an adverse event was 76 per every 100000 people the rate of paresthesia following the 2009 swine flu monovalent as03adjuvanted pandemic vaccine was 77 per every 100000 people  and was found to be the third most frequent adverse event following allergic and local reactions associated with the vaccine vaers reports of paresthesia following all vaccines administered between 20062016 were also collected and the rate of reporting per 100000 vaccinated people was calculated the number of vaccines administered was obtained from health resources and services administration data and statistics on vaccine rates according to the survey there were 7157 vaers reports of paresthesia between 2006 and 2016 out of a total of 3153876236 vaccinations administered during the same time period the rate of paresthesia following all vaccines between 2006 and 2016 was 02 for every 100000 people these data suggest the rate of paresthesia following covid19 vaccines is the same as the rate calculated in the de serres paper on paresthesia following the 2009 swine flu pandemic vaccine and is 38 times the rate seen in all vaccines during a 10year period of time wrote dr eileen natuzzi surgeon and public health epidemiologist paresthesia is an unrecognized adverse event following vaccination with the current covid vaccines natuzzi wrote the data is observational but suggests a signal of concern that should be studied in more depth survey data from 100 participants also showed the following results 79% of those surveyed experienced tingling vibrations and shaking 57% had numbness 53% reported heart issues 45% experienced muscle weakness and pain 44% experienced headaches 43% had fatigue 42% had stomach issues 39% reported brain fog 36% experienced involuntary twitching 29% had tremors 27% reported blood pressure issues 20% reported tinnitus pfizer pressures media outlet to pull vaccine injury story dobbs said she and others knew they needed to tell their stories without causing vaccine hesitancy to protect others from the same fate  so members of the group started writing and calling anyone who would listen including reporters news agencies and members of congress this is a hard thing to do without being labeled antivax fearmongering or a misinformation spreader dobbs said but there was nowhere else to turn for help a lot of us are so injured at this time that the very thought of getting out of bed was exhausting we had to persevere so that we could be seen heard believed and most of all helped dobbs said they tried the best they could as simple americans to reach out to those who would hear their stories finally a reporter from a small media company was willing to do a story dobbs and others from the group participated in a 2hour and 40minute interview the story never went anywhere dobbs said she said the reporter told them a higher up at pfizer made a call to the station and pressured staff there into not covering any other stories about vaccine adverse reactions kristi dobbs pfizer exec dobbs said she emailed dr peter marks director of the center for biologics evaluation and research (cber) at the fda but never heard anything from him she never received a response from nath at the nih either she explained ive been working my butt off to try and get my story out because i dont want this to affect other people but i dont see how perfect strangers that were living normal lives found each other through social media and there are thousands and thousands that have been affected but you hear nothing about these stories if its so safe then how have we found so many people on our own who have been affected by the vaccine dobbs did receive an email response from dr janet woodcock director of the fda who said she was sorry to hear about her symptoms and that the fda would look into the situation that was april 18 dobbs said i havent heard anything since dobbs also reported her adverse event to pfizer which did not followup and filed a report with vaers in june sen ron johnson (rwi) gave a few of the group members a platform at a press conference for the media to hear us see us and believe us dobbs said but they wanted nothing to do with us dobbs said their only questions were about who paid for us to get to wisconsin and are we going to sue for compensation of injuries no further questions about lack of medical care what they could do to help bring awareness nothing we did get some other interviews with newsmax and fox but again we were given a small platform for a moment and then hushed again we move one step forward and get two steps back dobbs said the group has tried to do their due diligence by reporting to the big pharma regulatory agencies although the nih has been fully aware vaccine injuries were occurring since february dobbs said she is working with other researchers  not affiliated with the nih  who are running totally different blood markers they were initially doing studies on covid longhaul patients to discover why they were becoming longhaulers when they realized people were getting injured by vaccines and experiencing the same symptoms dobbs said the one thing theyre finding that we all have in common is the spike protein in nonclassical monocytes dobbs said 1 million copies sold  the real anthony fauci  the book that launched a movement buy today dobbs wants government acknowledgment and accountability for vaccine injuries dobbs still has many of her symptoms is not well enough to return to work and has a difficult time caring for her family i was never a conspiracy theorist or antimedicine but it should not be this hard to get the truth out in 2021 dobbs said i am not saying the vaccine needs to be stopped but its not as safe or effective as theyre portraying it is dobbs said she would do anything to make sure others are protected from the same personal hell shes gone through the past nine months or to save children like maddie de garay  a 12yearold who was paralyzed by pfizers vaccine during the clinical trial dobbs was told specifically not to vaccinate any of her children which puts her in a tough spot with vaccine mandates i believe it would kill me if i got another covid vaccination and i would never put my children through this  ever she said however this also means theyre in the category of people who are discriminated against because they cannot get vaccinated dobbs said the moral of the story is that weve been injured by the vaccine weve been searching for months for answers and we are unable to get help we have reached out to the best doctors in the world and they cannot help us so if you cant get help from the top doctors in the us how can our hometown doctors help us we never wanted to start this we only wanted help and after not getting help you start to get a little angry when your body fails you want to know why we have some researchers willing to help us but they are hindered by a lack of information they need to conduct their research and there are no adverse reaction clinics where we can go to get treated dobbs said these reactions need to be investigated and observed then they need to be researched and education needs to be presented action needs to be taken for the correct measures to be issued to protect and compensate those of us who have been affected by the covid vaccines under clinical trials and under emergency use authorization treatment protocols must be implemented in our medical community to give early and proper treatment to those affected she added dobbs said she doesnt want to create vaccine hesitancy she wants accountability from governing agencies big pharma and institutes that regulate and roll out vaccines the fearmongering cancelculture and misinformation days of those truly injured must stop she said i have nothing to gain by giving my testimony of truth to my vaccine injury from the pfizer covid19 vaccine dobbs wrote in an email to the defender i was just a smalltown country girl raising my family and enjoying my life as a family caretaker mother and wife but i was completely uprooted from my beautiful normal happy life but my voice matters my story matters

and exposing the problems associated with vaccines as an internationally known speaker and author her many articles have been translated into at least 15 languages she offers online education on the topic of vaccines and her yearly mastering vaccineinfo boot camp is probably the most comprehensive training in the truth about vaccines found anywhere dr mikovits was the first one interviewed and during the course of that interview brian rose asked her about the covid19 vaccine that is being fasttracked with some pharmaceutical companies saying they will have a vaccine by this fall dr mikovits discusses the absurdity of giving a covid19 vaccine to healthy people who would already most likely have natural immunity she states so now youre going to inject an agent into every cell in the body i just cant even imagine a recipe for anything other than what i would consider mass murder on a scale where 50 million people will die in america from the vaccine watch her full statement dr mikovits is part of a new film being produced called plandemic and a trailer featuring her testimony has gone viral in recent weeks in spite of efforts to censor it with some estimates guessing that it may have been viewed by well over 20 million people already she states that the man who directed the smear campaign to try and silence her was dr anthony fauci currently on president trumps coronavirus

failed and i have to ask how do you sit here with confidence to call out these great forces and not fear for your life dr mikovits because if we dont stop this now we can not only forget our republic and our freedom but we can forget humanity because well be killed by this agenda watch the trailer (from our bitchute channel) of what is currently probably the most banned video in the world right now about a week after brian rose interviewed dr mikovits he did a show with dr sherri tenpenny he mentioned dr mikovits prediction that if we went full steam ahead with this new covid vaccine that 50 million people would die and asked dr tenpenny if she agreed not only did dr tenpenny say she agreed with dr mikovits prediction of deaths in the us from a covid vaccine but she stated that there would also be many who are injured by the vaccine who might wish they were dead there are some things worse than death watch her full response here is her full interview with brian rose on

(nejm) has found that wuhan coronavirus (covid19) vaccines are not even close to being safe for pregnant women like the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) claims they are dr simon thornley a senior lecturer at the university of auckland and dr aleisha brock also from new zealand say that a reanalysis of the data clearly shows that pregnant women should not be getting injected for the fauci flu it turns out that miscarriages during the first trimester are as high as 91 percent in women who take the jab the original data that was used by the federal government to authorize the jab for pregnant women in the first place clearly shows this based on this data the new zealand researchers calculated a range of 819 percent to 912 percent spontaneous abortions in women who get injected for the fauci flu before 20 weeks gestation we question the conclusions of the shimabukuro et al study to support the use of the mrna vaccine in early pregnancy which has now been hastily incorporated into many international guidelines for vaccine use including in new zealand the researchers wrote the assumption that exposure in the third trimester cohort is representative of the effect of exposure throughout pregnancy is questionable and ignores past experience with drugs such as thalidomide evidence of safety of the product when used in the first and second trimesters cannot be established until these cohorts have been followed to at least the perinatal period or longterm safety determined for any of the babies born to mothers inoculated during pregnancy pfizer says small print admits that data does not support jabbing pregnant women in an attempt to defend itself pharmaceutical giant pfizer noted that the fine print on its website does admit that the latest available data on its jab being administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccineassociated risks in pregnancy the cdc on the other hand is claiming ignorance according to its researchers there are not any obvious safety signals associated with jabbing pregnant women so the green light was given to authorize them in this demographic we are aware that some of the data has been used to calculate a higher rate of miscarriage the useless cdc claimed when it first authorized the jabs for use in pregnant women this is not an appropriate calculation based on the data available because more than 1000 pregnancies were ongoing and their outcome data was not available at the time of the report about 1025 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage useless cdc experts will continue to study the effects of covid19 vaccination on pregnancies and closely monitor any safety concerns the useless cdc is doubling down in defense of the shots claiming the miscarriage risk is well within the range of what is considered to be acceptable the agency also says that the benefits of getting injected while pregnant far outweigh any known or potential risks with few exceptions the useless cdc says that all pregnant women should roll up their sleeves and take the jab at warp speed it is still pushing the narrative that not getting the jab increases the risk of fatality or severe outcome

138	0	Survey shows over 500000 killed by the covid vaccines so far may 15 2022095 by steve kirsch steve kirsch substack a simple survey anyone can do provides convincing evidence that the covid vaccines have killed over 500000 americans they should be halted now executive summary a simple survey of my readers provided some extremely compelling evidence that 1) the us government has killed over 500000 previously healthy americans and 2) that the vaccine actually caused the deaths truth lives on at https//sgtreporttv/ it took me around 30 minutes to create the survey and 11 hours to wait for highly statistically significant results i was able to accomplish something in less than 12 hours that the cdc has been unable to accomplish in 18 months prove causality we see both dose dependency and enormous changes in acm deaths pre vs postvaccine we satisfy all five bradfordhill criteria applicable to vaccines we used 400 independent observers i should note that all follow my substack so they are correlated all have excellent judgment high intelligence and immunity from mass formation effects so they have the ability to see what is truly going on the survey compared the allcause mortality (acm) death rates just prior to a vaccine dose to the acm death rates immediately after the dose i predicted they would be dramatically higher after the dose and the effect would be dose dependent it appears i was right in fact the survey projects far more deaths than i thought possible the number of deaths computed from the reports could be as high as 2m americans but the 500000 number seems more credible so im discounting the result by 4x to account for biases and confounders i dont think there is any way anyone is going to be able to explain away these results once we redo the survey with a better set of controls (the next step) and these results are only counting the allcause mortality increase for just the one month after each shot we know you can die a year later from these vaccines we found dose #4 caused only a 127x increase compared with 55x to 83x for doses 1 and 2 respectively and 23x for dose #3 if this were a highly biased population dose 4 would have caused a larger discrepancy but its approaching 11 as wed expect the decreasing acm increase with later shots makes sense the vaccine eliminates anyone whose immune system is susceptible to autoimmune attacks on the spike protein if it hasnt killed you after 3 shots its less likely to kill you on shot #4 youre immune due to both survivor bias and the fact that your immune system has recognized the vaccine as an invader and clears it from the system quicker than on shots 1 and 2 this of course says nothing about its impact on effectiveness against the virus which is likely pretty minimal at this point which is a story for another day the higher acm differential on dose 2 was interesting this may be somewhat of a poison accumulation effect youre basically doubling the dose over a 4 week period rather than giving your body time to recover note that this factor is simply the difference between the acm before the shot vs after the shot we have no idea whether the acm goes back to baseline between shots or not it likely does drop we dont know how fast hence the progressively decreasing impact on acm increases due to the jab it could very well be that your acm is 11x your baseline months or years after the shots when you do the math based on these numbers well over 500000 people have been killed by the vaccines so far if the survey were more precise id expect lower acm increases but still a final death toll north of 500000 the 500k excess death estimate is supported by the actual us mortality numbers as being plausible (which have a total excess death count of roughly 1m deaths since jan 2021) my colleagues are looking at this data and mulling over it we have identified a very large signal that i dont think will go away when we redo the survey we will need to think carefully about the next iteration of the survey and have the protocol peer reviewed to eliminate biases before we launch it now we know this will be time well spent so dont break out the champagne just yet but i think youll want to get it ready we are getting very close introduction i thought my may 13 survey would be important i was right i hit the jackpot on this one even if the effects are 100x smaller than what we found its still 10x more than any reasonable stopping condition for a vaccine (>1 death per million vaccinated) everyone i know has reported more deaths after vaccination than the number of deaths right before they were going to be vaccinated thats impossible if the vaccines are safe if the vaccines are perfectly safe the death rates immediately prior to any dose should be exactly the same as the death rate immediately after the dose the death rate should not be dose dependent it should be 11 on every single dose (for the death rate beforeafter) guess what both of these rules are violated not by a little by a lot like a factor of 5x to 8x increase in acm in the month after the shot compared to the month before the shot according to 400 independent investigators and this is a very statistically significant result just 11 hours after i posted my substack article pvalue calculation on the dose 1 acm change shows it is very unlikely it happened by chance the cdc had 18 months to do this sort of survey and still hasnt done it they probably never will its a valid study it just needs to be redone just a bit more carefully the data you can download the survey results here (xlsx file) this is the first 400 form submissions people may try to game the system after this point so subsequent data may be unreliable but these first 400 responses were made under the radar and i have the email address of the person who submitted each row so that politifact can verify every line of course they wont fact check me because if they verify it its game over fact checkers can do their own survey and report the results if they game the outcome it will be very clear that they are not credible eventually the ny times will do the same survey and validate the results it may be several years before they attempt do that though the graphs here are the graphs from the survey (first 437 responses) so you can visualize the results forms response chart question title i am a number

number of responses 374 responses forms response chart question title number of people i know who died within 4 weeks **after** they got booster #2 (dose 4) number of responses 374 responses the back of the envelope quick analysis what this means is devastating to the safe and effective narrative it also destroys the cdc argument that there is no link between vaccines and death it would be hard for them to explain this away the acm effect is huge it is statistically significant and it is dose dependent so lets do the math im just going to use round numbers because this is just an estimate to do it right wed stratify by age but were going to use average death rates etc around 3m people die a year in the us which is roughly a 086% death rate they dont die evenly throughout the year so like i said this is just a rough estimate just to find the ballpark number according to google (which uses our world in data) 250m got dose 1 the monthly death rate is 250m/12*0086 = 179k so if acm is elevated to 5x normal wed expect 4*179k= 716k excess deaths just from the dose 1 effect whoa thats way higher than i expected and higher than the 610k available to us so i believe our survey is overstating the effect 220m got dose 2 so wed do the same math as before our spreadsheet shows a 8x normal death rate in the following month so (81)*(220/12*0086)= 11m excess deaths whoa one shot does it all 100m got booster which shows a 23x increase so (231)*(100/12*0086)=93k excess deaths so 716+1100+93 = 19m excess deaths clearly caused by the vaccines is 19m excess deaths too high thats equivalent to a 40% acm increase over the entire 18 month period (not just in a few quarters) so based on our very simple survey wed predict the vaccines caused 19m excess deaths total so far due to the allcause mortality impacts whoa i wasnt expecting that that seems way too high we cant see that in the cdc or medicare numbers and those look consistent with each other the most we can find is 1m excess deaths so this is 2x too high if our calculations are right it would mean 31% of all deaths over 18 months (19/(19+28*15)) are from the vaccine what is interesting is that weve talked to embalmers who are seeing well over 60% of the deaths they do have these strange clots only found in vaccinated people that likely precipitated the death so our survey is actually very consistent with the embalmer data in fact we undershoot that data point if we go lower how do we explain the high rate of these telltale clots our vaers excess death estimate used 12000 us deaths in vaers (subtracting out background deaths)*41 (the urf) = 492000 estimated excess deaths caused by the vaccine but the vaers estimate should be conservative since the urf was calculated for the very best case event so any practical urf should be higher than 41 so we have consistency in our prediction (since the vaers estimate is a minimum)

140	0	Vaers data indicates the covid vaccines have killed at least 140000 people by vasko kohlmayer to get an idea of just how dangerous the current covid vaccines are we only need to look at the numbers in the governmentauthorized vaers database as you may know vaers is an acronym for vaccine adverse event reporting system this system is comaintained by the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and the food and drug administration (fda) this is how the fda describes this facility on its website vaers is an early warning system used to monitor adverse events that happen after vaccination vaers is the frontline system of a comprehensive vaccine safety monitoring program in the united states vaers gives vaccine safety experts valuable information so they can assess possible vaccine safety concerns including the new covid19 vaccines it is especially useful for detecting unusual or unexpected patterns of health problems (also called adverse events) that might indicate a possible safety problem with a vaccine established in 1990 the idea behind vaers is to capture as many adverse reactions to vaccines as possible in order to alert health experts to potential issues and problems the graph below traces the number of deaths that have been reported to vaers every year since its inception as you can see the yearly levels have held relatively steady from 1990 until 2020 and were generally under 400 cases the cumulative total of all reported deaths during those years comes to 5178 (see vaers analysis here) this however changed dramatically toward the end of 2020 when the covid vaccines were introduced at that point we see a rapid explosion in reported deaths so exponential was the increase that the graph line shoots up almost vertically see the link for the chart source here as of november 26 2021 the number of deaths reported to vaers in connection with the covid vaccines was 19532 it is both astonishing and revealing that in the last 11 months there were more reports of vaccine deaths related to covid shots than to all other vaccines combined during the previous three decades this should raise all kinds of red flags because it is a good indication that there may be something seriously wrong with the covid vaccines and that these hastily authorized pharmaceuticals are causing death on an unprecedented scale the 19532 tally does not however give us an accurate picture of the situation to get a sense of the true state affairs this number needs to be adjusted for two very important factors the first concerns the nature of vaers data itself while the second relates to the way in which it is collected adjustment for causality to begin with we need to recognize that not all deaths reported to vaers are due to the vaccines to see why we must understand the difference between a temporal and causal connection even though the bulk of reported deaths normally occurs within a relatively short time of vaccination  usually from days to weeks  it does not necessarily mean that all those who have died after having taken the vaccine perished because of it in some cases people who appear among vaers entries died of causes unrelated to the vaccine and they just happened to receive their injections in temporal proximity of their passing in order not to overstate the case when considering vaers data it is therefore important to keep in mind that reported cases do not necessarily imply causality the question then becomes in what proportion of vaers entries a causal link can be established to help us make this assessment we use the findings of a peerreviewed study that examined this issue the title of the study is causality assessment of adverse events reported to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) the study was published in 2012 and you can view it at this link at the national library of medicine the study found a definite or probable causal link between the vaccine and the adverse event in 23 percent of entries in the vaers database in another 20 percent of cases a causal link was possible in order not to inflate our numbers we will assume that a definite or a probable link exists in only 20 percent of death entries entered into vaers in connection with the covid vaccines in other words we will assume that in 8 out of 10 entries the vaccines were not responsible for the demise of the person we will take this cautious position despite the fact that in most cases the filing party  mostly health care professionals  believed that the reported deaths occurred as a result of the vaccine to put it in a different way we will assume that the filers were mistaken 80 percent of the time when we adjust the 19532 figure for this variable we obtain 3906 (19532 x 02) this would be the number of deaths that were definitely or likely attributable to the covid vaccines per the vaers records adjustment for underreporting this number however does not accurately reflect the real death toll of the vaccines this is because it is well known that the vaers numbers are vastly underreported the underreporting is due to a host of reasons most doctors for example are hard pressed for time and they do not wish to go through the timeconsuming administrative process of filing claims which is a task for which they receive no compensation doctors are also generally discouraged by the environment in which they work from reporting this kind of data in order not to shed a bad light on pharmaceutical products which are the lifeblood of modern medicine be that as it may it is an undisputed fact that only a very small fraction of the actual adverse events end up being reported to the vaers database a number of authorities believe that fraction to be one percent or less one of them is dr david a kessler a former fda commissioner who  in support of his 1993 article thesis  referenced a study that found that only about 1% of serious events are reported to the fda kessler should know of which he speaks since in addition to his highprofile appointments as a public health official he also holds a medical degree from harvard and a law degree from the university of chicago kesslers view was reaffirmed by a 2010 report by harvard pilgrim healthcare for the us department of health and human services which concluded that fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported (see page 6 of the report) ronald a kostoff is another highprofile scientist who believes that one percent is the correct estimate in a recent paper he observed historically vaers has been shown to report about 1% of actual vaccine/inoculation adverse events if these authorities are correct then the underreporting factor (urf) of the vaers database is 100 to ensure that they err on the side of caution rather than the other way around some researchers use a more conservative urf in their analysis steve kirsch for example generally uses the underreporting factor of 41 in his calculations the lowest urf factor this writer has come across in the work of credible analysts is 36 in order to be as conservative as possible we will use this figure in our analysis if we then adjust our vears number for this variable we will obtain the result of 140616 (3906 x 36) this would represent the number of americans killed by the covid vaccines in a period of fewer than 12 months starting in middecember 2020 through november 26 2021 observations please keep in mind that the above is a very conservative estimate which we have arrived at by assuming a 20 percent causality link in reported death entries in the vaers database and the underreporting factor of 36 this however is likely a gross understatement of the actual situation using less conservative assumptions many researchers have come up with a higher death toll steve kirsch jessica rose and mathew crawford for example estimated in their paper that the vaccines have likely claimed 150000 lives as of august 28 2021 if we use the underreporting factor of 100 (one hundred) advocated by david a kessler ronald kostoff and the department of health and human services we would arrive at the figure of 390600 deaths attributable to the vaccines it is quite probable that these figures are closer to the actual vaccine death toll than the one we obtained based on our cautious assumptions be that as it may we can say with a considerable degree of confidence that based on the vaers figures it is very likely that the covid vaccines have killed or directly contributed to the deaths of at least 140000 americans by claiming the lives of so many people in such a short time the covid vaccines are the deadliest pharmaceuticals ever released into wide circulation correction comparison of causialties in vietnam war was

141	0	Massacre more than 10000 europeans killed by covid19 vaccines according to official eu data posted by eu times the european database of suspected drug reaction reports is eudravigilance which also tracks reports of injuries and deaths following the experimental covid19 vaccines here is what eudravigilance states about their database this website was launched by the european medicines agency in 2012 to provide public access to reports of suspected side effects (also known as suspected adverse drug reactions) these reports are submitted electronically to eudravigilance by national medicines regulatory authorities and by pharmaceutical companies that hold marketing authorisations (licences) for the medicines eudravigilance is a system designed for collecting reports of suspected side effects these reports are used for evaluating the benefits and risks of medicines during their development and monitoring their safety following their authorisation in the european economic area (eea) eudravigilance has been in use since december 2001 this website was launched to comply with the eudravigilance access policy which was developed to improve public health by supporting the monitoring of the safety of medicines and to increase transparency for stakeholders including the general public the management board of the european medicines agency first approved the eudravigilance access policy in december 2010 a revision was adopted by the board in december 2015 based on the 2010 pharmacovigilance legislation the policy aims to provide stakeholders such as national medicines regulatory authorities in the eea the european commission healthcare professionals patients and consumers as well as the pharmaceutical industry and research organisations with access to reports on suspected side effects transparency is a key guiding principle of the agency and is pivotal to building trust and confidence in the regulatory process by increasing transparency the agency is better

142	0	After more than a year sarscov2 is still killing people but we are learning more about how it does its lethal damage although covid is thought of as a respiratory disease many victims have damage to their heart and other organs plus neurologic symptoms such as headaches impaired consciousness hallucinations loss of smell and taste and stroke yet the virus does not seem to invade the heart or the brain directly what researchers do find is blood clots both microscopic and large the whole virus may not be needed to cause harm the spike protein alone can evidently damage the lining of blood vessels leading to blood clots spike protein injected into mice crossed the bloodbrain barrier caused neurologic signs (thirst and stressed behavior) and was taken up by other tissues the covid vaccines produced by pfizer moderna and astrazeneca contain genetic material that induces the vaccinated persons own cells to manufacture spike protein which then stimulates production of antibodies intended to attack the virus in a dec 8 submission to the us food and drug administration (fda) vaccines and related biological products advisory committee (vrbpac) pediatric rheumatologist j patrick whelan md phd expressed concern that mrna products through spike proteins have the potential to cause microvascular injury [inflammation and small blood clots called microthrombi] to the brain heart liver and kidneys in ways that were not assessed in the safety trials in an urgent open letter to the european medicines agency (ema) physicians and scientists called for responses to a number of issues including blood clots due to the binding of the viral spike protein to platelets unless their safety concerns are adequately addressed in studies the signatories demand that approval of use of genebased vaccines be immediately withdrawn there are serious concernsthat the approval of the covid19 vaccines by the ema was premature and reckless and that the administration of the vaccines constituted and still does constitute human experimentation which was and still is in violation of the nuremberg code more than a dozen countries suspended administration of the oxfordastrazeneca vaccine when fatal blood clotting disorders were reported but resumed use when ema declared it safe and effective the vaccine was said not to increase the overall risk of clots an israeli organization anshei emet has filed suit in the international criminal court in the hague claiming that the governments coercive mass vaccination campaign is a human experiment violating the nuremberg code which requires informed consent people have to prove they have been vaccinated even to enter a bar the lawsuit claims that the ministry of health has admitted to a 41% incidence of severe side effects in medical and police personnel in the us people are supposed to sign a consent form to receive the vaccine the form for the moderna product reads i voluntarily elect to receive the covid19 vaccination at [] after carefully considering the risks and benefits it might not be entirely clear that you take the vaccine at your own risk as manufacturers have no legal liability for adverse effects																
143	0	Can covid vaccines cause cancer in some cases the answer appears to be yes to be sure there is no evidence that covid vaccines themselves are carcinogenic (ie cancercausing) however it has been shown that in up to 50% of vaccinees covid vaccines can induce a temporary immune suppression or immune dysregulation (lymphocytopenia) that may last about a week or possibly longer in addition covid mrna vaccines have been shown to reprogram (ie modify) adaptive and innate immune responses and in particular to downregulate the socalled tlr4 pathway which is known to play an important role in the immune response to infections and cancer cells thus if there already is a tumor somewhere  known or unknown  or if there is a predisposition to some type of cancer such a state of vaccineinduced immune suppression or immune dysregulation might potentially trigger sudden tumor growth and cancer in the weeks following vaccination of note lymphocytopenia has also been frequently observed in cases of severe covid rapid progression of tcell lymphoma following pfizer booster shot rapid progression of tcell lymphoma following pfizer booster shot (goldman et al) at the immunological level a similar mechanism appears to be triggering the postvaccination reactivation of latent virus infections most notably vzv (ie shingles) but also ebv (epsteinbarr) and hpv the vaccineinduced temporary immune suppression is also a likely factor contributing to the postvaccination spike in coronavirus infections observed in many countries the extent of the vaccineinduced tumor growth and cancer issue remains uncertain  it might be very rare  but there are already a few thousand such case reports in the notoriously incomplete official adverse event reporting systems and in vaccinerelated online patient groups although some of these cases may certainly be coincidental or even due to lockdownrelated delayed diagnosis in august us clinical pathologist dr ryan cole described a significant increase in certain types of cancer (eg endometrial cancer) since the beginning of the covid mass vaccination campaign (see video excerpt below full video here) more recently german pathologists also noted the issue of postvaccination immune dysregulation and sudden tumor growth in some patients dr ryan cole on postvaccination cancer (full video read a fact check) in addition to the already wellestablished cardiovascular adverse events  such as blood clots strokes heart muscle inflammation and menstrual disorders  several autoimmune diseases have also been linked to covid vaccines including neuroinflammatory conditions such as guillainbarre syndrome and multiple sclerosis (ms) which may be caused by antigenic crossreactivity postvaccination hearing loss and tinnitus have recently been covered by abc news as for pregnant women while many health authorities recommend that they get vaccinated the actual pfizer vaccine trial in pregnant women continues to be delayed for lack of participants meanwhile the us vaers reporting system counts already more than 2000 postvaccination miscarriages in children it was thought that vaccination would prevent covidrelated pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (pims) instead it turned out that covid vaccines may themselves trigger pims which is most likely caused by an immune reaction to the spike protein vaccineinduced pims was first noticed in israel and has recently been confirmed by ema the eu medicines agency the benefit of covid vaccination in children is so uncertain that vaccine trials had to switch from relevant endpoints (ie reduction in disease or death) to dubious proxy indicators like antibody response meanwhile a recent us study found that in healthy male adolescents the risk of postvaccination myocarditis is about five times higher than the risk of covid hospitalization a recently published study in mice found that if mrna vaccine gets into a vein the heart muscle absorbs the mrna starts producing coronavirus spike protein gets attacked by the immune system and develops inflammation and cell damage (ie myocarditis) this is likely what happens in humans too if the vaccine accidentally gets injected into a blood vessel instead of muscle cells havent official vaccine trials shown that covid vaccines are safe though the answer is no in fact several serious adverse events were already observed during covid vaccine trials but were discarded as unrelated in addition the pfizer vaccine trial excluded five times more people from the vaccine group than from the control group in the pfizer vaccine trial for adolescents as 12yearold girl suffered permanent paralysis but pfizer reported her case merely as abdominal pain as for the potential risk of vaccineinduced antibodydependent disease enhancement (ade) there continues to be no realworld evidence for this effect but several molecular simulation studies found that future variants of the delta strain might potentially trigger ade (ie nonneutralizing antibodies enhancing viral infection as was the case with vaccines against sars1 and dengue) the best channel to study case reports of covid vaccine adverse events is covid vaccine injuries (18+) however the wellinformed reader should also study a website called sorry antivaxxer which documents vaccine skeptics (or even virus skeptics) who died from covid data from israel shows that covid vaccines provide no durable protection against infection while protection against severe disease decreases from about 95% to about 50% within half a year thus people at high risk of severe covid should in any case consider early treatment options including monoclonal antibodies once in severe condition covid treatment becomes much more difficult israel and some other countries have already started booster vaccinations but important safety questions remain according to an israeli report one percent of people sought medical help due to side effects of the third vaccine dose in a german retirement home 10% of people suffered serious adverse events after the third vaccine dose and two people (of 90) had to be resuscitated speaking of israel an israeli civil rights group has recently produced an important onehour documentary called the testimonies project detailing serious covid vaccine injuries based on interviews with israeli citizens and their relatives (see video below) globally covid vaccines may already have killed or severely injured more than 100000 people given the lack of vaccine protection against infection and transmission as well as the rather concerning safety profile it is clear that there is no medical ethical or epidemiological justification for covid vaccine mandates or vaccine passports indeed the who regional director for europe recently acknowledged that covid vaccines wont be able to suppress the virus thus the pandemic will end as usual through widespread and durable natural immunity in the best case covid vaccines may help mitigate initial infections in highrisk groups																
144	1	With a third covid19 shot also known as a booster shot being recommended against the battle of covid19 the possibility of people needing yearly booster shots is on the horizon new research shows it may be a good idea to combine flu and covid vaccines into one shot according to the cdc you are able to get both the flu and covid vaccine in the same visit but it takes two separate needles combining the two shots could make it easier for people to get vaccinated against covid19 and the flu it would make it so much simpler where you know its a onestopshop where you can take care of everything and not have to come back or make a separate appointment sometime in the future said marlon mansour who was visiting san luis obispo county dr robert schooley with uc san diego health said people who have time constraints or difficulty managing multiple vaccine appointments could benefit from a combined shot if you separate them and you end up having to make separate appointments or the schedules are different the chances youre going to get both taken care of are much lower said dr schooley a study published in the lancet journal on january 31st followed 300 people that were split into three groups one group was given just the flu vaccine the second group just mrna covid19 booster and the third group was given a mixture of the two the study found people who got the mixed vaccine had just as many antibodies against covid as people who received just the booster shot the same results were reflected with the flu vaccine group other data found that all three groups had similar side effects and no serious reactions were reported many said they would be open to the idea of a combined shot as more research is done id say just off of personal experience its something i would be comfortable with of course like most people i think with research more that you guys put out there and promote and get the positive effects i definitely would be more comfortable taking it said claudia salina who is still considering this idea much more convenient you know the first priority is always safety so you always want to make sure everything has been trialed before it happens said alexus councehooker who is open to a combo shot moderna reported working on a combined covid19 and flu vaccine and hope to have it ready by winter of 2023																
145	1	Molly longman april 7 20217 min read in the hours before the first covid19 vaccine was approved in the us for emergency use i was on the phone with epidemiologists and medical experts who were detailing the expected advantages to widespread vaccination thered be fewer deaths and fewer severe cases of covid19 so hospitals wouldnt be so overwhelmed the folks i spoke to called the news a light at the end of the tunnel moment getting shots in as many arms as possible would be key to achieving herd immunity they said so we could eventually return to some semblance of prepandemic normalcy but as the three approved us vaccines  pfizer/biontech moderna and johnson & johnson  have rolled out to more than 100 million americans weve learned there may be more unexpected benefits to vaccination than experts initially saw coming here are just a few of them many of the vaccines offer at least some protection against the variants though the swift vaccine rollout has made the future look brighter than it has in a while theres at least one ominous cloud hanging over us covid19 variants which are mutated strains of the sarscov2 virus experts say that some may be more contagious and possibly more deadly than the original strain youve likely heard of the b117 the b1351 and the p1 variants which have hit britain brazil and south africa respectively when these strains were first identified experts werent sure whether the existing vaccines would protect against them fortunately studies have shown that both messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) vaccines (pfizer and moderna) are highly effective against the b117 variant and while these vaccines are four to seven times less effective against the p1 variant they still may offer a cushion of protection especially after two doses anthony fauci md director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases said during a white house press briefing early research pointed to the idea that both mrna vaccines and johnson & johnson would be less effective against the b1351 variant however early this month pfizer released trial data showing their vaccine was 100% effective in preventing covid19 in south africa where b1351 is common to be on the safe side the developers of all three of the vaccines that have been approved in the us are working quickly to try to make their formulas more efficacious against the variants and are experimenting with booster shots all the vaccines work really well for severe disease right now and likely offer some protection against the variants says preeti n malani md chief health officer at the university of michigan im optimistic but we still need to be careful right now some covid19 long haulers say the vaccines are relieving their symptoms between 10% and 30% of folks who get covid19 experience longterm symptoms the national institutes of health notes some people whove dealt with lingering issues are now saying that the vaccine helped ease their symptoms its getting to be a large number of reports hundreds of reports of patients that weve been caring for with covid almost a year now daniel griffin md phd chief of infectious disease at prohealth told cnn they are reporting that following vaccination theyre having significant if not complete resolution of their long covid symptoms in a survey of 345 people  most of whom lived in britain and were women  32% reported their lingering covid symptoms improved two weeks or more after their first vaccine does other researchers are looking into this too though no peerreviewed studies have been published on this topic its too early to say why the vaccine may ease longterm symptoms its possible that lingering issues occur in people who are unable to fully clear the virus from their bodies the vaccine could prompt a robust reaction from the immune system to nix the virus that causes covid19 once and for all its also possible that long covid symptoms are caused by a form of immune dysfunction the vaccine may prompt an immune reset that resolves the issues dr malani explains we still dont understand why some people are at risk for [long covid] she adds but the fact that we are even hearing anecdotes of people saying theyre having reduced symptoms after the vaccine is promising the covid19 shots pave the way for future vaccine research in 1796 the first ever vaccine was created for smallpox when a british physician injected a patient with pus from the sores of a milkmaid who had contracted a biologically related virus from cows the association of american medical colleges notes until 2020 a similar method was used for all vaccines (minus the pus)  patients received often inactivated or weakened versions of the virus itself but what scientists have learned while developing mrna covid19 vaccines may pave the way for future vaccines including for diseases such as hiv influenza zika and rabies (human trials for mrna vaccines against these diseases were already underway precovid19 an analysis in nature notes) unlike other vaccines mrna vaccines work by instructing our cells to make proteins or pieces of proteins that help our body recognize a key piece of the virus and create an immune response to it the vaccine field has been forever transformed and forever advanced because of covid19 dan barouch md phd director of the center for virology and vaccine research at harvard medical school told the aamc pregnant people may pass immunity on to newborns although the vaccine trials didnt include pregnant people for ethical reasons more than 69000 pregnant people have been vaccinated in the us to date and early research suggests the vaccines are likely safe and effective during pregnancy not to mention preliminary findings from the american journal of obstetrics and gynecology also indicate that if a pregnant person gets the vaccine while expecting they might provide protection to newborns as well this builds on other research that showed that vaccinated people may pass antibodies to covid19 through the placenta to the fetus more research is needed to confirm these findings but if its true it would be big news as some newborns are more vulnerable to severe illness and its unlikely a vaccine will be approved for this age group any time soon the vaccination may make people less contagious for the most part the covid19 vaccines keep people from contracting the virus in the first place but in the rare case that someone does test positive postjab their viral load will likely be much lower than an unvaccinated persons suggests an israeli study (that fair warning has not yet been peerreviewed) there are two benefits to having a low viral load (which refers to the amount of virus detected in someones system) theyll be less at risk for severe disease and they may not spread the virus to others as easily the vaccines can reduce covid anxiety sure we knew getting the vaccine would be a relief  but many people are saying that they didnt expect to feel so good postshot over the last year people have been afraid to do normal things like seeing their friends and family and theyve been really lonely dr malani says being isolated and being lonely are big health risks too and they can take a physical toll on both younger and older adults for some getting vaccinated and letting go of the covid anxiety feels like taking the first deep breath of fresh air in a year after the second shot  i had that aha moment that things are looking up and we are moving towards our new normal whatever the new normal will be new yorker alexa nikiforou says there was a feeling of hope																
146	1	Fda scientists say benefits of pfizer covid19 vaccine clearly outweigh the risks for children ages 5 to 11 matthew herper by matthew herper oct 23 2021 reprints 9 pfizer kids brianna banuelos 12 receives a first dose of the pfizer covid19 vaccine at a los angeles county mobile vaccination clinic in may patrick t fallon/afp via getty images scientists at the food and drug administration presented an analysis late friday showing that the protection offered to children between the ages of 5 and 11 by the covid vaccine developed by pfizer and biontech would clearly outweigh the risk of myocarditis a heartrelated side effect that the vaccine appears to cause the fdas analysis was made public ahead of a tuesday meeting of outside scientists convened to make a recommendation on authorizing the vaccine for children in that age range an agenda for the meeting shows sessions dedicated to the vaccines effectiveness and to the potential risk of myocarditis an inflammation of the heart the fda is not bound by the votes of its advisory committees but it generally follows their advice new data from pfizer were also made public on friday they show that the vaccine is about 91% effective in preventing covid19 in 5 to 11yearolds while benefits of vaccination were highly dependent on covid19 incidence the overall analysis predicted that the numbers of clinically significant covid19related outcomes prevented would clearly outweigh the numbers of vaccineassociated excess myocarditis cases over a range of assumptions for covid19 incidence agency researchers wrote trending now she was told girls dont do that now margaretmary wilson is a top executive at unitedhealth group however the researchers noted if the rate of covid19 was to fall to levels seen in june 2021 there would be more vaccineassociated myocarditis cases than covid19 hospitalizations but even then the fda staff said given the more severe nature of covid19 hospitalization the overall benefits of the vaccine may still outweigh the risks under this lowincidence scenario much of the committees discussion is likely to center on the benefits of the vaccine which dramatically reduces the chances a child will become infected with sarscov2 the virus that causes covid19 as well as its potential risks in older boys and young men the vaccine has been linked to myocarditis it has occurred in somewhere around 1 in 10000 boys and men between the ages of 16 and 19 who received a second dose though estimates of the risk vary new data in the briefing documents show that the pfizer/biontech vaccine not only cuts the risk of infection but also reduces the risk of symptomatic covid19 in children who do become infected with sarscov2 among the 1518 children in the study who received the vaccine there were three cases of symptomatic covid19 among the 750 children who received placebo there were 16 cases of the disease  meaning the vaccine was 907% effective previously only data about childrens ability to produce antibodies against covid19 after vaccination and not its effectiveness at preventing illness were available symptoms among the vaccinated children who developed covid were very mild none had fevers by contrast 10 of the 16 children who were not vaccinated who developed covid19 developed fevers and generally had worse symptoms common side effects were generally similar to those caused by the adult vaccine and included headaches and fevers the pediatric shot is 10 micrograms or onethird the adult dosage of the volunteers in the study 52% were male 79% were white 6%% were black and 6% were asian american related dont give covid19 longhaulers the silent treatment data were also included in an expansion group of 1591 additional children who received the vaccine and another 788 who received placebo although all have not been followed for 25 weeks for these children information is available only about side effects it appears that the fda may be willing to make a decision on the vaccine without data from this extension study because children are less likely to experience severe consequences of covid19 the panel will likely discuss whether the benefits of protection outweigh the small risk of myocarditis or other side effects covid19 itself can cause myocarditis at a much higher rate than the vaccine too few younger individuals have been treated to have a clear idea of the risk of myocarditis researchers still do not fully understand why it occurs although some patients with vaccineinduced myocarditis have needed intensive care the fda said most had their symptoms resolve with conservative management because myocarditis occurred only rarely in clinical trials its difficult to estimate exactly how often it occurs in its briefing documents the fda said that myocarditis and pericarditis a related inflammation of the hearts lining were reported to the us governments vaccine adverse events reporting system (vaers) at a rate of 715 cases per million in vaccinated males ages 16 to 17 and 426 cases per million in males ages 12 to 15 that equates to about one case per 12000 for 16 to 17yearolds and one case per 24000 for 12to15yearolds but the fda also analyzed a database of claims from optum part of the insurer unitedhealth group in that database the estimated excess risk of myocarditis and pericarditis approached 200 cases per million in fully vaccinated males aged 16 to 17 and 180 cases per million in vaccinated males aged 12 to 15 years of age thats about one case per 5000 vaccinated boys the question though is not just what is the risk of myocarditis but whether the benefit of the vaccine outweighs that risk and the benefit of vaccinating anyone depends on how many cases of covid19 are occurring the fda modeled how many hospitalizations would be prevented by vaccinating a million boys in the 5 to 11 age range at six different points in the pandemic most of the time the vaccine would prevent 200 to 250 hospitalizations per one million vaccinated boys but at one point in june 2021 when cases were plummeting nationwide the vaccine would only have prevented only 21 hospitalizations per one million boys at any point the number of myocarditis hospitalizations caused by the vaccine would be the same the fda estimated it as 98 hospitalizations per million boys vaccinated so normally even in the highestrisk group the number of covidrelated hospitalizations prevented would be double the number of hospitalizations due to myocarditis but when the virus is under control the number of myocarditisrelated hospitalizations in boys in this age group would be slightly more than covidrelated hospitalizations because covid19 cases would be so low the fda argues that even in this case outcomes for those hospitalized with covid19 would be worse than those with myocarditis and that it chose to model a high rate of myocarditis meaning the condition may be less common newsletters sign up for the readout your daily guide to whats happening in biotech enter your email privacy policy in pfizers briefing documents made available ahead of the meeting the company cited data from israel where its vaccine is the main one in use and data on myocarditis have been closely tracked in these data the risk of myocarditis after a second dose in 12 to 15yearold boys was 1 in 12000 pfizer said about half that in males aged 16 to 19 thats based on 12 cases that occurred in 255444 adolescents only one of those cases was in a female vaccine recipient pfizer said in its documents that assuming the 90% efficacy figure on the vaccine holds up vaccinating one million 5 to 12yearold children would prevent 33600 cases and 170 hospitalizations over 120 days during the same period of time there would be 21 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis a draft agenda for tuesdays meeting shows that the committee will view presentations on myocarditis and other risks and on the benefits of the vaccine according to the briefing documents the panel will consider whether based on the totality of scientific evidence the benefits of the twodose vaccine outweigh its risks for use in children 511 years of age if the fda decides to authorize the vaccine its use will then be evaluated by a separate panel convened by the centers for disease control & prevention if that committee also recommends its use and the cdc director agrees the vaccine will be made available																
147	1	Why travelers should get the covid19 vaccine doctor wearing ppe administering vaccine to a patient doctor wearing ppe administering vaccine to a patient (photo via istock/getty images plus/zoranm) although the travel industry adjusted during the pandemic to allow travel to continue with covid19 testing measures i decided to limit my travel last year to one solo road trip for a travel writer one trip in a year isnt typical but i wanted to do everything that i could to keep myself and others safe but things are changing the vaccine is now available its increasing travel bookings and im excited to say that im going to get my first shot of the vaccine today trending now coronavirus outbreak coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals including camels cattle cats and bats royal caribbean royal caribbean extends sailing protocols through summer tropical exotic paradise coastline beach of dili in east timor at dawn (photo via jackmalipan / istock / getty images plus) asia travel requirements a country by country guide woman digital health pass passport covid19 vaccine vaccination verification certificate credentials pandemic qr code wttc releases report outlining digital travel portal blueprint traveler with a covid19 rapid test at the airport cdc updates us travel guidance with new recommendations travel savings budget money covid19 no longer the biggest concern for many travelers the benefits of the covid19 vaccine to our daytoday lives are apparent it can prevent you from contracting the virus can protect those around you and can lower the spread of covid19 those three reasons are enough to convince me to get the vaccine but maybe you need a few more not only will the covid19 vaccine make traveling much easier for you but its also the responsible thing to do heres how 1 why ruin your trip with a hospital visit if im going to put money and time into a trip im going to do everything that i can to make the travel experience run as smoothly as possible this means packing a bag of overthecounter medicines and following the cdc suggestions for certain shots like yellow fever or hepatitis a  and you guessed it  getting the covid19 vaccination id rather not pencil in hospital visit to my itinerary even if i didnt need to visit the hospital after contracting the virus i would have to quarantine in a hotel and the costs associated with that could be great why ruin a perfectly good vacation with the possibility of getting the virus when the vaccine would limit my chances considerably 2 you might have to get the vaccine the covid19 vaccine might be your ticket to boarding a cruise or entry into certain countries in the boardrooms and the upper echelons of different travel industry sectors travel leaders are deciding how and when to best implement vaccine requirements into their travel services some countries like the islands of seychelles and georgia are now allowing vaccinated travelers including americans to enter their countries without having to quarantine american queen steamboat company and crystal cruises are requiring guests to get vaccinated and there is an indication that other cruise lines are also considering this as a requirement its a little early to know exactly how many airlines cruises hotels tour groups or countries will require covid19 vaccinations but we do know that its being discussed and highly considered 3 it will make traveling easier without the vaccine you might be required to get tested before and after your trip and quarantine for a certain amount of time at the destination with the vaccine you might get to skip the uncomfortable test or required quarantining 4 you can travel to more places as i mentioned with the vaccine you can now visit seychelles and georgia thailand is also allowing americans with the vaccine to visit the country without quarantining we might expect other countries to have similar regulations when they open their borders for instance americans are currently barred from entering countries in the european union because the us is considered a highrisk country due to how many covid19 cases we have when the eu does open to americans again it might only be with proof of receiving the covid19 vaccine 5 getting the vaccine will make you a responsible traveler the most important reason to get the covid19 vaccine before you travel is that its the right thing to do if youre vaccinated youre less likely to put tour guides hotel workers flight attendants and the entire travel industry workforce at risk for contracting the virus additionally youd be protecting the people in the community in which youre visiting this is especially important if youre visiting areas like new mexico and arizona with high indigenous populations who have been suffering greatly in the pandemic the same can be said for the people in communities of developing countries like mexico or certain caribbean islands who do not have access to quality healthcare hospitals or the vaccine while the vaccine will make traveling easier for you i think we should be especially mindful of this last reason travel is a privilege and we should do it with mindful intentions to be kind and respectful to those who live in the areas in which we are visiting that means  protecting their health so get the covid19 vaccine as soon as possible and preferably before you take any trips so that you can protect yourself and others																
148	1	Benefits of covid19 vaccination outweigh the rare risk of myocarditis even in young males by catalina jaramillo posted on march 1 2022 | updated on april 5 2022 this article is available in both english and espanol english scicheck digest rare cases of myocarditis have been reported following the mrna covid19 vaccines particularly among young males after a second dose most cases resolve quickly without the need for advanced therapies although research on any potential longterm effects is ongoing nonetheless the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks in all populations even in young males full story myocarditis or inflammation of the heart muscle is most often caused by a viral infection research shows that infection with sarscov2 the coronavirus that causes covid19 increases the risk of myocarditis across age groups but myocarditis and pericarditis inflammation of the outer lining of the heart have also been identified as rare side effects of the mrna covid19 vaccines most cases of vaccineassociated myocarditis have been observed in adolescents and young males ages 12 to 24 following a second dose according to a centers for disease control and prevention study published in jama on jan 25 postvaccine myocarditis is most frequent in the us in males 16 to 17 years old with 1059 cases per million doses  or about 106 per 100000 that study and others have found that compared with classic viral myocarditis postvaccine myocarditis appears to resolve faster and have better clinical outcomes although investigations into potential longterm effects are ongoing in patients with vaccineassociated myocarditis symptoms such as chest pain shortness of breath palpitations or fatigue usually appear within a week of vaccination and resolve within a few days case studies show that most patients have been hospitalized but most of them have recovered with rest and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen with very few needing intense therapies in contrast typical viral cases of myocarditis can have a more variable clinical course cdc experts point out in the jama study for example up to 6% of typical viral myocarditis cases in adolescents require a heart transplant or result in mortality cardiologists interviewed for this story told us based on their experiences with patients vaccineassociated myocarditis appears to be less frequent and severe than myocarditis following sarscov2 infection in adults young adults and children they said patients arriving to the hospital with heart inflammation after an infection often get admitted in the intensive care unit and need advanced therapies to rescue them including an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine a life support machine that takes over for a persons heart and lungs post covidvaccination myocarditis which has been shown to be less severe  typically does not require treatment and it runs its course and does not require any other therapies other than just supportive care dr joyce w wald a cardiologist medical director of the shock team and director of heart failure transplant and mechanical circulatory support program at the university of pennsylvania health system told us in an interview dr matthew elias an attending cardiologist in the cardiac center at childrens hospital of philadelphia told us patients with heart issues triggered by covid19 go through a very scary and lifethreatening experience while those with myocarditis following vaccination are observed for a few days and their symptoms typically resolve with ibuprofen or no medication at all honestly so very different experience room to room he said in a phone interview heart issues are much more common and theyre much more severe with the infection compared to the vaccine preliminary cdc data on postvaccine myocarditis in patients ages 12 to 29 show most patients had no impact on their quality of life and that 81% of them were either fully recovered or probably fully recovered and awaiting additional information at least 90 days after a diagnosis a young man receiving the covid19 vaccine in a medical clinic photo by ivan pantic via getty images myocarditis and other complications associated with covid19 researchers and health officials emphasize are more frequent than those linked to the vaccines and the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks in all populations including male adolescents and young adults a large study published in nature medicine on feb 7 looked at cardiovascular outcomes in us veterans one year after a sarscov2 infection and found that covid19 increased the risk for several heart disorders including heart attacks arrhythmias strokes cardiac arrests and myocarditis sarscov2 infection can cause severe disease in children too either from covid19 or from a complication known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children misc is a rare syndrome following coronavirus infection in which at least two organs often including the heart become dangerously inflamed the condition can cause myocarditis and may lead to acute heart failure in children update april 5 a cdc study published in the morbidity and mortality weekly report on april 1 found that the risk for cardiac complications including myocarditis pericarditis and multisystem inflammatory syndrome was significantly higher after a sarscov2 infection than after receiving an mrna covid19 vaccine for both males and females in all age groups even among males aged 1217 years the group with the highest incidence of cardiac complications after receipt of a second mrna covid19 vaccine dose the risk was 1856 times as high after sarscov2 infection than after vaccination the study says the incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis among males ages 12 to 17 was 560 to 649 cases per 100000 after infection compared with 267 to 359 after the second vaccine dose the study was based on 40 health care systems data on 152 million people ages 5 and up from jan 1 2021 through jan 31 2022 no one in the us is known to have died from vaccineassociated myocarditis according to the cdc as of jan 13 in contrast as of feb 23 there have been 5796 covid19 deaths among people ages 18 to 29 and 851 covid19 deaths among those 17 and younger specifically in adolescents ages 16 to 17 where vaccineassociated myocarditis has occurred at the highest rate there have been 18 million cases of covid19 reported and 327 covid19 related deaths as of feb 24 however the rare risk of myocarditis continues to be misleadingly used to argue that covid19 vaccines are dangerous and that young males and children are better off without them there are plenty of examples of this in the media we recently factchecked a video of dr robert malone claiming with no evidence that covid19 vaccines can damage your children and that many of these damages cannot be repaired weve also reported on unfounded claims that link covid19 vaccines to athletes collapsing or dying from myocarditis another example is republican sen rand pauls remarks in a jan 21 interview on fox news the ingraham angle in arguing that its medical malpractice to force vaccines on children particularly adolescent males he said we now have the scientific evidence that shows the risk of myocarditis for young males is greater for the vaccine than it is for the disease pauls office told us his remarks were based on an unpublished paper posted to a preprint server on dec 25 by a team of researchers from the united kingdom that found that in males under 40 the risk of myocarditis was higher following a second dose of the moderna vaccine than after a sarscov2 infection the preprint nonetheless concludes that for the overall population the risk of hospital admission or death from myocarditis is greater following covid19 infection than following vaccination the same team had previously published a larger study in nature medicine with the same conclusion pauls remarks  as with most of the claims that use myocarditis to say that vaccines are dangerous for that age group  are missing context as we have said experts say the risk of myocarditis associated with the vaccine is rare and more importantly that everyone including young males could face much more serious outcomes from contracting covid19 covid can kill you covid can cause you to go to the hospital go to the intensive care unit and die dr paul offit director of the vaccine education center at the childrens hospital of philadelphia and a member of the fdas vaccines and related biological products advisory committee told us in a phone interview although i agree that the children are generally infected less frequently and when theyre infected theyre infected less severely  they can be infected severely to the point that they are hospitalized or die the cdc concluded as recently as feb 4 that the benefits of both mrna covid19 vaccines far outweigh the risk of myocarditis even in younger males in a benefitrisk analysis presented to the agencys advisory committee on immunization practices the cdc estimated that for every million males between the ages of 18 and 39 who were vaccinated with a second dose 1799 and 1900 hospitalizations would be avoided with the moderna and pfizer/biontech vaccines respectively compared with 68 and 47 expected cases of myocarditis per million second doses these estimates have inherent limitations they are based on the agencys current understanding of how often people are hospitalized with covid19 and develop vaccineassociated myocarditis and they dont reflect vaccine performance against omicron or factor in previous infection for example but even if they are off by a large margin its likely the benefits would still outweigh the harms its nevertheless possible that if conditions change such as if circulation of the coronavirus plummets that the riskbenefit calculus could shift in other words if the risk of contracting covid19 is low then fewer hospitalizations would be avoided through vaccination reducing the benefit of vaccination for young males potentially below the risk of vaccineassociated myocarditis but the current data strongly favor vaccination source cdcs advisory committee on immunization practices feb 4 myocarditis following mrna covid19 vaccination evidence of an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis particularly in young males and after a second dose of an mrna vaccine has been accumulating since it was first identified in may 2021 experts say cases were not detected in clinical trials because the incidence in the general population was too small with a rate of less than 4 per 100000 in june 2021 experts presented early data about the frequency of vaccineassociated myocarditis to the fdas vaccines and related biological products advisory committee and to the cdcs advisory committee on immunization practices cdcs experts estimated the highest rate was 667 per million after a second dose among males ages 12 to 17 with the frequency declining in older males and generally lower rates in females on june 23 the acip concluded that the benefits provided by the covid19 vaccines clearly outweighed the risks of myocarditis after vaccination fact sheets for patients and health care providers for the moderna and pfizer/biontech covid19 vaccines have included warnings since june 25 newer analyses have roughly confirmed those initial estimates according to the january cdc study published in jama myocarditis remains a rare but serious adverse event of the mrna covid19 vaccines the analysis was based on 1626 cases of myocarditis reported to the vaccine adverse event reporting system between december 2020 and august 2021 among 354100 845 doses of mrna vaccines administered it found that although the overall frequency of postvaccine myocarditis is low there was an increased risk of myocarditis for males and females across multiple age groups after vaccination the highest rate of cases occurred after the second dose in adolescent males 16 to 17 years old (1059 per million doses) followed by those 12 to 15 (707 per million doses) and those 18 to 24 years (524 per million doses of the pfizer/biontech vaccine and 563 per million doses of the moderna vaccine) another recent study published in the new england journal of medicine on jan 26 by israeli researchers found similar results they tracked hospitalizations for myocarditis from june 2 to oct 20 among vaccinated adolescents ages 12 to 15 and found the rate of myocarditis cases in males was 056 per 100000 after a first dose of the pfizer/biontech vaccine and 809 cases per 100000 after the second (one case per 12361) the risk for female adolescents was much lower  069 cases per 100000 after the second dose all the cases were clinically mild dr dror mevorach head of the hadassah hospital ein kerems internal medicine department and his team reported in the study the risks of myocarditis following second mrna vaccination even in adolescent and young adult males remain low dr leslie t cooper jr a myocarditis national expert and chair of the department of cardiology at the mayo clinic in florida told us in an email with most cases being mild these risks should be weighed against the competing risks of hospitalization and death from infection by the recent sarscov2 variants to explain what researchers mean by clinically mild wald from penn medicines cardiology team gave us some context severe would be somebody coming in with myocarditis whos unstable hemodynamically meaning that theyre not getting enough blood theyre in shock  they need advanced therapies to rescue them from this event she said most patients with postvaccine myocarditis do get hospitalized because youre going to want to make sure that you watch them and that it doesnt turn into something more severe but the majority only need treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and were asymptomatic by the time they were discharged she said so thats what we mean by mild the same applies to children chops elias says mild should be in quotes because kids with vaccineassociated myocarditis do typically get hospitalized and are observed for a few days but it is referred to as mild because its so much different than misc and also much different and less severe than classic myocarditis he said children are typically admitted to the hospital observed for a few days they typically have normal heart function when we perform echocardiograms and then their symptoms which is primarily chest pain resolved quickly within a day or two he said with minimal medication the mechanisms for development of myocarditis after an mrna covid19 vaccine are still not clear although scientists have proposed a few possible mechanisms some experts believe sex hormones play a role that would explain why it occurs mostly in younger males similar to typical myocarditis we dont know the mechanism but a theory that attributes a protective role to estrogen or a risk associated with testosterone is reasonable it makes sense at least based on epidemiological data dr enrico ammirati a myocarditis expert at de gasperis cardio center and transplant center at the niguarda hospital in italy told medscape cardiology in january he added however that scientists do not have any direct evidence in human beings cooper told us some studies suggest that the risk of postvaccine myocarditis is higher with the moderna vaccine than with the pfizer/biontech vaccine some of the evidence presented on feb 4 at an acip meeting corroborates those findings but after reviewing all the available data in a meeting that resulted in a recommendation for full approval of the moderna vaccine for people 18 years and older health officials said the desirable consequences of the vaccine still clearly outweigh undesirable consequences in most settings the fda arrived at the same conclusion according to documents presented when the vaccine was granted full approval on jan 31 according to the agencys own benefitrisk assessment based on the current evidence and a higher rate of postvaccine myocarditis after a second dose in males ages 18 to 25 the analyses support the benefits of vaccination over the risks of myocarditis/pericarditis for individuals 18 years of age to mitigate the risk of myocarditis and improve vaccine effectiveness several countries have recommended lengthening the interval between the mrna vaccine doses from four weeks to between six and 12 weeks while others recommended giving males or those under 30 the pfizer/biontech vaccine on feb 22 the cdc issued new covid19 mrna vaccine guidance recommending to extend the interval between the doses to eight weeks for some people ages 12 and older especially for males ages 1239 years some studies in adolescents (ages 1217 years) and adults have shown the small risk of myocarditis associated with mrna covid19 vaccines might be reduced and peak antibody responses and vaccine effectiveness may be increased with an interval longer than 4 weeks extending the interval beyond 8 weeks has not been shown to provide additional benefit there are currently no data available for children ages 11 years and younger the cdc said some countries paused or delayed second doses of mrna vaccines in adolescents due to concerns of myocarditis but then recommended them after the appearance of omicron taiwan for example stopped giving second doses for people ages 12 to 17 on nov 10 but resumed them by the end of the month the uk delayed its recommendation for a second dose for adolescents ages 16 to 17 in august but then went ahead with it in november in september hong kong began advising that teens 12 to 17 years old receive only one dose of the pfizer/biontech vaccine a cohort study published in jama pediatrics on feb 25 found the policy reduced the risk of myocarditis in that group but as the authors explain the study was conducted before omicron when the country had virtually no local transmission of the virus and the risk of death or covid19 complications was extremely low in countries with large outbreaks and  prevalent local transmission the riskbenefit assessment would favor a 2dose regimen because the singledose regimen provides suboptimal protection from severe outcomes associated with covid19 the authors say in october the fda said it needed additional time to evaluate the emergency use authorization of the moderna vaccine for adolescents 12 to 17 to analyze the risk of myocarditis after vaccination no determination has been made to date myocarditis following sarscov2 infection as we previously said covid19 and misc both caused by a sarscov2 infection are associated with myocarditis source centers for disease control and prevention a cdc study published in september 2021 found that patients with covid19 had nearly 16 times the risk for myocarditis than those without the disease although the risk varied by sex and age male and female covid19 patients under 16 had almost 37 times the risk for myocarditis than those without infection the study suggested the risk was 74 times higher for patients between 16 and 24 and 67 times higher for patients 25 to 39 years old males had a higher risk than females about half of children with misc a rare complication of covid19 infection develop myocarditis as of jan 31 the cdc had reported 6851 cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and 59 deaths with most cases occurring in children 5 to 13 studies suggest that in the general population the risk of myocarditis is significantly higher after a sarscov2 infection than after vaccination a study from israel published in the new england journal of medicine on aug 25 found that vaccination with the pfizer/biontech vaccine was associated with a smaller excess risk of myocarditis (27 additional events per 100000 people) than a sarscov2 infection (11 additional events per 100000 people) and a large study published in nature medicine that looked at rates of hospitalizations or death from myocarditis pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias following vaccination or a covid19 positive pcr test in the uk also found that infections were much more likely than vaccines to cause myocarditis and other heart complications [w]hilst there are some increased risks of rare heart related complications associated with vaccines these are much lower than the risk associated with getting covid19 for example we estimated between 1 and 10 extra events of myocarditis in 1 million people vaccinated with a first or second dose but 40 extra cases in 1 million people infected with covid19 julia hippisleycox professor of clinical epidemiology and general practice at the university of oxford and study lead said in an interview for an oxford website that study though did find differences in risk by age with vaccineassociated myocarditis more likely among the under40 crowd the risks are more evenly balanced in younger persons aged up to 40 years where we estimated the excess in myocarditis events following sarscov2 infection to be 10 per million with the excess following a second dose of mrna1273 vaccine being 15 per million the authors wrote referring to the moderna vaccine the unpublished study that paul cited to support his claim that the risk of myocarditis for young males is greater for the vaccine than it is for the disease is an expanded analysis by the same team which added data from children ages 13 to 17 and from people receiving a booster the new data didnt change the conclusions for the overall population  the risk of hospital admission or death from myocarditis is greater following covid19 infection than following vaccination it says but it found that in males under 40 the risk of myocarditis following vaccination was similar to infection  and in what the authors termed a notable exception the risk was higher than infection following a second dose of the moderna vaccine in younger males its possible then that the risk of myocarditis is higher after a covid19 vaccine than after covid19 for certain people particularly younger males but that doesnt mean people shouldnt get vaccinated focusing solely on myocarditis is misleading because it ignores the fact that sarscov2 infection comes with other dangers including a medley of other heart complications no vaccine or medical product is 100% safe but as chops offit told us the choice to not get a vaccine is not a riskfree choice either its just a choice to take a different risk he said and that different risk is the greater risk elias agrees heart issues whether we call it myocarditis or myocardial injury or misc  these issues are much more common

possible

150	1	Why students should get a covid19 vaccine why do college students need to get vaccinated  many young people will experience persistent covid symptoms months after their initial illness  young adults are responsible for most of covid19 spread  college students congregate in group settings where the covid19 virus can easily spread  the omicron variant the most common variant in nd is highly contagious (may cause more than 3x as many infections as delta)  getting vaccinated will prevent infections and help limit the spread of disease keeping college students and staff safe covid19 vaccines are safe  the cdc recommended the mrna covid19 vaccines (moderna and pfizer) as the preferred vaccines the fda has given full approval to the pfizer covid19 vaccine which is the fdas strongest endorsement of safety and efficacy  it is normal to have some side effects after receiving the vaccine side effects are typically mild and include injection site pain swelling or redness mild fever chills fatigue headache and muscle and joint aches these will usually go away in a day or two  while covid19 vaccines have been linked to rare more serious side effects the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks associated with covid19  there is no evidence that the covid19 vaccine can lead to infertility for more information about vaccines and infertility click here covid19 vaccines are effective no vaccine is 100% effective however covid19 vaccines are the best way to protect yourself and those around you from this virus (including the omicron variant) the vaccines continue to provide significant protection against severe disease hospitalization and death a majority of all recent covid19 hospitalizations and deaths are among unvaccinated people covid19 vaccines are free there should be no outofpocket costs for covid19 vaccine it is possible that health care providers may charge a fee to administer the vaccine health insurance will cover any potential fee those who are uninsured and/or unable to pay the administration fee will not be turned away updated 1/14/2022 you need the covid vaccine even if you have already had covid the cdc recommends that everyone be vaccinated regardless of whether they already had covid19 because  many individuals who have had covid are being reinfected with the omicron variant vaccination provides additional protection against reinfection  covid19 vaccines provide a stronger and more consistent immune response than natural infection  it is nearly impossible to predict who is at risk for reinfection among previous positives  being vaccinated is your best protection against variant strains of covid should i get a covid19 booster booster doses are now recommended for everyone 12 and older you should receive a booster >5 months after your primary series if you received moderna >5 months after your primary series if you received pfizer and >2 months after your primary series if you received johnson & johnson if you are 18 or older you may choose which covid19 vaccine you receive as a booster shot new data suggests protection offered by the primary series of covid19 vaccines may be waning over time and may be less effective against new variants like omicron boosters have been shown to boost your immunity and provide the best protection against omicron for more information on boosters click here how else can college students help prevent the spread of covid19 other ways to prevent the spread of the covid19 include wearing a face mask practicing social distancing of at least 6 feet avoiding large gatherings cleaning frequently touched surfaces minimizing touching eyes nose and mouth and washing your hands frequently with soap and water																
151	1	The benefits of the mrna covid19 vaccine fiona waters february 01 2021 share if you havent thought about getting the covid19 vaccine out of concerns that it is a new technology have no fear with mrna vaccines you may actually be exposed to fewer pathogens and ingredients than those which are required to culture or grow the vaccine in a conventional way whats in a name coronavirus is a large category of viruses that both humans and animals can get covid19 is short for coronavirus disease 2019 sarscov2 stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 the virus that causes covid19 how a vaccine works all pathogens have a signature shape on their surface for sarscov2 that unique shape is a spike protein when someone is exposed to sarscov2 naturally the immune system learns to recognize it by its spike protein binding to an immune cell in the future if your immune system encounters more sarscov2 spike proteins it can defend itself this type of immunity only lasts for around five months though on top of that many people never recover if they experience fever shortness of breath or other severe complications the mortality rate of covid19 in the us may be up to 10 times higher than the mortality rate of the flu vaccines are an attempt to give a person immunity without the danger of being exposed to a deadly pathogen an illustration of a sarscov2 cell including spike proteins image credit desiree ho for the innovative genomics institute conventional vaccines today many vaccines require raising copies of a virus in chicken egg cells or mammalian cells the virus a scientist raises is similar to the one being targeted but its been weakened so that you cant get sick from it to your immune system though it looks just like the real thing too much time raising viruses has its downsides for one thing it takes a lot of time the yearly flu vaccine is a good example of why the vaccine production process needs to be sped up flu shots are designed months before they are distributed by the time winter rolls around because the flu virus and its strains change extremely quickly the strains that the vaccine was originally designed for may have been replaced its still far more effective than no flu vaccine but it would be more effective if it did not take so long to manufacture too many logistics the other problem with conventional vaccines is how complicated the process is a lab has to successfully develop and grow a virus for a vaccine then it has to ship samples of this model vaccine physically to pharmaceutical companies the pharmaceutical companies then have to successfully raise their own viruses each time they distribute a batch of the vaccine logistical issues have even affected the supply of flu shots in the past too risky if we used conventional vaccines to resolve this pandemic biologists would need to grow an overwhelming number of vaccines for distribution that is they would have to take the time (and risk) to develop a weakened strain of the virus and then raise it for months in cells until it reproduced for the flu having fewer vaccines is less of a lifeordeath scenario it requires a vaccination rate between 30% and 75% to be effective (this is known as herd immunity threshold and it has never been achieved without vaccines) the flu also has a much lower mortality rate and fewer complications than a sarscov2 infection dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases predicts between 75% and 80% of us citizens need to be vaccinated to manage covid19 cases that means we need a lot more covid19 vaccines than we do for the flu and they are indispensable there is no room for error in the production process mrna vaccines conventional vaccines take a long time to grow require a lot of risky research in order to be perfected and require a complex process of being raised in a lab and then being physically shipped to pharmaceutical companies thats where mrna vaccines have stepped in there is no need for pharmaceutical companies to have access to a model and no chicken egg cells or mammalian cells involved in this process instead of containing an entire inactive virus an mrna vaccine only contains the instructions an immune cell needs to recognize the spike protein these instructions are based on a single dna template the sequence of which can be shared via computer instantly an experimental batch can be created in roughly a week compared to many months for vaccines that are grown in cells if mrna vaccines dont contain a copy of the virus though how does your immune system learn to recognize sarscov2 rather than stimulating your immune system with the actual virus covid19 vaccines tell your body to generate copies of the harmless spike protein on the surface of sarscov2 this triggers an immune system response as if you had encountered the virus naturally while your immune system forms a memory or plan of attack for sarscov2 you are never actually exposed to it using this technology in future vaccines would speed up their development reduce their cost and improve access by standardizing the production process i see this scientific breakthrough as one similar to the spread of electricity the internet and digital finance breakthroughs has a fantastic infographic comparing the two production methods too new (and somehow too old) while mrna vaccines have never been used in humans on such a large scale they were being researched as far back as the 1990s the main reason they werent implemented into vaccines for people was not for safety reasons it was that synthetic rna could easily be destroyed by the body before it reached immune cells until recently the technology simply wasnt effective some have also expressed their concerns that the vaccine designed last year will not work on recent mutations of covid19 scientists have found that current vaccines may be less effective against mutants but exactly to what degree is still being researched some protection is better than none and early research suggests that the current vaccine is only slightly less effective against variants and as a reminder new mrna vaccines can also be developed and released quickly if need be with their speedy production method too fast my favorite analogy for this sped up process comes from the podcast sawbones items shipped to you overnight go through the same chain of ship plane or truck as a standard delivery your overnight delivery is simply prioritized to get to you faster without compromising the package the same is true of vaccines created under an emergency use authorization [science] could move this fast all the time explains dr sydnee mcelroy if you have the money and the political will and the resources and the backing and the belief of all the people involved too political alex azar the head of health and human services who was nominated by trump had the power to authorize a vaccine before the fda had fully vetted it pressure from public health experts ensured that the fda completed its testing in full and without interference from the white house the first dose of vaccine in the us was approved in december long after the presidential election important information there are many different types of vaccines currently in use that dont use the chicken egg cell/mammalian cell process many of the most common vaccines in the us however do use the wholepathogen method of inoculation including flu shots measles mumps and rubella combined vaccine chickenpox vaccines smallpox vaccines polio shots and others no vaccine is perfect the covid19 vaccine can have some side effects but they are temporary severe reactions that result in hospitalization are extremely rare as authors wayne c koff and michelle a williams put it compare that to the virus itself which has infected more than 70 million people globally and killed approximately 16 million the covid19 vaccine has only been approved for those 16 or 18 and older it hasnt been tested or approved for those who are pregnant and with certain health conditions that makes it all the more important to get the vaccine if you are able not only does it protect you but it also protects the people around you who cant be vaccinated																
152	1	One vaccine endless potential the unexpected benefits from one of the latest covid19 vaccines by danielle groen | may 19 2021 one vaccine endless potential the unexpected benefits from one of the latest covid19 vaccines discoveries from mrna vaccine technology will change the ways we treat infection combat cancer and fight food insecurity on a windy monday morning in late january natalia martin orozco tucked 30 frozen vials into a shipping box filled with dry ice then slid the package into the trunk of her car for the 30minute drive to a toronto clinic when she arrived martin orozco the chief development officer of providence therapeutics handed the box to one of the waiting nurses who placed the vials in a freezer over the next two hours the group discussed how to handle the vials how to thaw them and crucially how to administer what they contained the first fully madeincanada covid19 vaccine to enter human trials later that day 45 volunteers received their initial dose of providences twoshot mrna vaccine (15 volunteers received a placebo) if everything goes well with this phase one clinical trial  no adverse reactions promising levels of antibodies  providence should start its phase two trial in april martin orozco hopes that by the end of the year the third and final trial will have wrapped so they can secure approval from health canada and begin vaccinating the public in 2022 it felt like the first day of daycare when you drop off your child  its hard but you know everything will be fine martin orozco says it certainly took us nine months to get to this point and the delivery to the clinic gave us a lot of hope seeing our efforts to help reduce the pandemic those efforts werent part of the original plan the team at providence therapeutics had been developing mrnabased vaccines to fight cancer not infectious disease this time last year they were on the cusp of the first clinical trial for their ovarian cancer vaccine then covid came and everything went into lockdown martin orozco says we didnt know when we could restart but providence did have all they needed to make a vaccine pivot the raw material the uptocode facility the right personnel and they knew the enormous potential of mrna  a technology that is not only transforming the landscape of vaccination but can accelerate and change the ways we treat infection combat cancer and even fight food insecurity whats mrna again think of messenger rna or mrna as microscopic blueprints for the body theyre the sequences of genetic material that tell our cells how to assemble proteins each protein has a unique sequence  like for example the infamous spike protein that the coronavirus uses to pick the lock of our cells once scientists were able to determine the sequence that codes for the spike they could produce the sequence synthetically in the chemistry lab says richard bozzato senior health adviser at mars when that mrna sequence is injected into the body our cells read the blueprints build the spike protein and then  recognizing that spike as something foreign and dangerous  mount an immune response against it what are the advantages of an mrna vaccine vaccines can be made in various ways but historically none of them has been especially speedy long before they get to the jab researchers need to grow vast quantities of the virus  or an important piece of that virus  in eggs or in cells synthesizing mrna on the other hand can be done in a relative flash its no coincidence that pfizer and modernas mrna vaccines were the first to receive health canadas approval these companies were in human trials before anyone else remember going back to february and march people were saying oh its going to take years before a vaccine is developed bozzato says well 66 days after the genetic sequence of the virus was available moderna treated its first patient in a phase one clinical trial with this technology they were able to react very very quickly as it turns out mrna vaccines arent just lightning fast theyre astonishingly effective early in the pandemic many infectious disease experts dr anthony fauci included believed theyd have to settle for a vaccine protection rate of 70 per cent just 50 per cent would have been enough to secure who approval but modernas vaccine is 941 per cent effective pfizers vaccine clocks in at 95 per cent and early animal trials indicate providence therapeutics candidate looks just as good here too mrna vaccines have an advantage over traditional approaches typically the body is responding to a finite dose of the vaccine  lets say 10 milligrams of the spike protein injected into the arm but because mrna vaccines deliver the spike proteins blueprint rather than the spike itself those blueprints can be passed around from cell to cell the mrna stays in the cells for a while martin orozco says so the same 10 micrograms of vaccine can be read several times to produce greater amounts of the spike protein generating a more robust immune response mars impact health june 22 and 23 join the inaugural conference exploring the frontiers of health innovation save $50 on early bird tickets until may 20  learn more what does mrna technology mean for covid variants to survive a virus must make copies of itself all the time and in enormous numbers inevitably mistakes happen slight mutations that alter the viruss genetic sequence if were lucky these mutations dont make much of a difference if the virus is lucky though the variations mean it can outperform its earlier self were seeing these changes with the brazilian covid strain the south african strain the uk variant martin orozco says theyve allowed the virus to be more successful and effective the coronavirus doesnt yet appear to have mutated so dramatically that it evades the protection of modernas and pfizers vaccines altogether but the benefit of mrna technology is that it allows vaccine developers to be extremely responsive we can very quickly adapt to a new target martin orozco says simply by synthesizing the mrna that codes for the new variants we can have a newgeneration vaccine ready for trials right away what does mrna technology mean for cancer cancer is a much more complex disease than covid19 theres no single target like the spike for a vaccine to protect the whole population against but the speed and precision of mrna sequencing means a company like providence therapeutics can focus on personalized medicine the technology makes purposebuilt vaccines for cancer patients possible how by sequencing a patients tumour the team at providence identifies mutations specific to that particular patient from those mutations they determine which targets  better known as antigens  will be recognized by the patients immune system then use them to develop the vaccine its a process that takes start to finish just eight weeks this approach which is called immunooncology basically stimulates your own immune system to fight cancer by presenting to your body something unique to the tumour bozzato says as providence sequences and collects targets from their personalized cancer vaccines martin orozco hopes they might also move to general medicine we want to start identifying common antigens and distinguish which ones were the most effective she says those antigens could be encoded into mrna technology for quick vaccination and maybe even for cancer prevention as well and what does rna technology mean for gene editing nearly a decade ago crispr revolutionized gene editing with a system of enzymes and guides that offered the fastest cheapest and easiest way to manipulate dna crispr contains two components says aaron chung ceo of spindle biotech theres the cas9 enzyme which can make very precise cuts to the genome then theres the guide rna  not fundamentally different than mrna chung says and best understood as the controlf to edit the genome it finds the particular block of code causing the trouble and directs the cas9 enzyme to snip away crispr has huge implications for our planet its used to make crops less susceptible to disease or more resistant to drought to create zikaproof mosquitos or reefbuilding coral to meddle with cancer cells or test for covid19 but that necessitates a great deal of guide rna which can get quite expensive thats where spindle comes in we have a costeffective method to synthesize highpurity guide rna chung explains that allows more crispr experiments to be conducted to engineer crops or cure cancer or solve world hunger powered by guide rna he says synthetic biology will change the world of course as the pandemic barrels into its second year the world still looks very different but it finally feels like theres light at the end of the tunnel  thanks in no small part to the contributions of mrna vaccines in that sense we were lucky mrna technology that had been developed over many years had come to a point of maturity so it could be deployed almost immediately bozzato says and were just starting to see what the mrna platform can do adds bozzato its here to stay																
153	1	Ten reasons why you should get a covid19 vaccine sam wood 10 december 2020 markusspiskednbtfbnqlrcunsplash by https//unsplashcom/@markusspiske } here are the ten reasons you should get the covid19 vaccine at the brink of an unprecedented covid19 vaccination campaign some may still not be sure whether the benefits outweigh the risks here professor martin michaelis and dr mark wass of the school of biosciences give the ten reasons why you should get vaccinated 1) its rapid development does not mean it is less safe vaccine development often takes a long time but this is not the case for the covid19 vaccination this is because it was not hindered by the typical issues vaccine development encounters the first being little commercial interest for them and thus less funding and the second being that trial participants and infections are hard to come by there was no shortage of money trial participants or infections for covid19 vaccines but we have also been lucky and the vaccines work the current covid19 vaccines have been tested in more patients than most previously approved vaccines though experience with the current covid19 vaccines only covers about six months the method of the oxford/ astrazeneca vaccine have been found safe in clinical trials for more than ten years and mrna vaccines such as the biontech/ pfizer and moderna vaccines for more than three years hence the vaccines are as safe as they can be having been tested in more patients than would normally be possible 2) the vaccines cannot cause covid19 because they do not contain the coronavirus the vaccines do not contain the complete virus and are not infectious so they simply cannot cause covid19 in patients with immune defects or a weakened immune system they may be less effective but will still be safe 3) the vaccines do not interact with dna none of the vaccines interacts with our dna hence a manipulation of dna is technically impossible 4) most side effects are caused by the desired immune response most of the reported side effects to the vaccine in trials are caused by the immune system response many infectious disease symptoms are caused by the immune system not pathogens this is why it is often difficult to tell apart infectious diseases because they cause overlapping symptoms (eg runny nose sinus congestion cough body aches) such postvaccination symptoms do not indicate a disease but the immune response that will eventually provide protection 5) most alleged side effects are probably not caused by vaccines unfortunately people get sick all the time also independently of covid19 given the size of the covid19 vaccination programme it is inevitable that some people will develop health conditions shortly after vaccination the causes of which have nothing to do with the vaccine 6) the natural infection may kill you instead of providing better immune protection though we do not know what level of protection is provided by a natural covid19 infection we do know that the vaccines are very effective and protect 9/10 individuals since the disease and their vaccines are still very new we cannot know how long immune protection either after natural infection or vaccination may last the vaccines may provide more effective protection than natural disease particularly for very mild or asymptomatic covid19 even if natural infection provided better protection than vaccines it is still dangerous in simple contrast to a vaccine covid19 can kill you 7) you protect yourself and others this is not only about you many in our society have conditions preventing them from developing an effective immune response to vaccination which makes them highly vulnerable to covid19 we do not know the extent to which the covid19 vaccines will prevent individuals from being able to transmit the virus however since they protect individuals from disease we can be reasonably sure they reduce the likelihood of disease transmission therefore you will protect others by getting the vaccine 8) be realistic on the level of safety expected from a vaccine and the danger covid19 poses some people expect vaccines to be 100% safe which is unrealistic if we put the same restrictions on our lunch removing food that was not 100% safe we would remove all food from our diets you must consider the vaccine in the context of the disease covid19 has already killed one in a 1000 uk people without a vaccine eventually we all will become infected probably more than once no serious sideeffects have been found in the tens of thousands of people that have received the covid19 vaccines therefore the covid19 world is a safer place with a vaccine than without 9) the more people getting vaccinated means the greater a success it will be vaccinations are show to have a greater effect on a population if the majority of people have undergone it the more people dont have the vaccine the more flareups of the disease there will be over time 10) lastly if still debating be as critical with both arguments against and in favour and youll see the evidence is clear still not convinced then do your own research but do so in an objective and unbiased way you will find the scientific evidence in support of the vaccine is overwhelming if this still does not convince you that a vaccine is the right choice ask yourself what would change your mind if the answer is nothing it probably means that you reject the vaccines for ideological rather than rational reasons vaccines will not resolve all of our covid19 problems but they will enable us to progress to a new normal without the current strict restrictions in 2021																
154	1	Why is it important to get the covid19 vaccine getting vaccinated (source people) the covid19 pandemic is still wreaking havoc across the globe but now we have a major weapon in our fight against this virulent disease the covid19 vaccine while getting vaccinated might not be compulsory in india it is extremely important that you do so at the earliest possible opportunity this is because the covid vaccine can protect you and the members of your household against the disease and greatly reduce your chances of serious illness and hospitalization things to keep in mind before your vaccination as of may 1 2021 all individuals above the age of 18 are eligible for the vaccine however before they get the shot there are a few points to remember before taking the covid vaccine you need to register to get the vaccine one needs to register on the cowin portal you can either do this directly on the cowin website or app or through the aarogya setu app book a slot once you have registered on cowin you can look for available slots at covid vaccine centres (cvcs) near you and schedule an appointment you can also see which vaccine you are getting at the centre on the app getting a covid test while it is not required to take an antibody or rtpcr test for covid19 before taking the vaccine some doctors recommend it just to ensure you are negative prior to vaccination taking medication the covid vaccine might result in a few side effects but it is very important not to take any medication before you receive the vaccine to reduce side effectsthis is because they might affect how the vaccine works however you will be free to take paracetamol or other painkillers to deal with side effects after getting the shot what are the steps for getting vaccinated once you have booked your vaccine appointment here are the steps that you need to follow when visiting a centre to get your dose step 1 appointment details when you book your appointment you will receive an sms with the date time and place to get your vaccination save this message step 2 confirm your appointment before you go contact the vaccination centre to confirm your appointment (using your personal reference id from the cowin portal) step 3 correct documents make sure that you have the photo id card that you used to book your appointment as well as your aadhaar card (always wear a mask or two masks when you step outside) step 4 check in at the centre head to the vaccination centre that you have chosen and show your confirmation sms and id card to the vaccination officer no 1 (vo1) step 5 get your details verified a second vaccination officer (vo2) will cross verify and authenticate your details and documents on cowin step 6 waiting you might need to wait for up to an hour before your name is called step 7 get the vaccine when your name is called another vaccination officer (vo3) a healthcare practitioner will administer the dose of the vaccine to you step 8 monitoring time once the vaccine is administered you will be asked to wait in an observation area for 1530 minutes so that the health worker can see if you have any unusual reaction step 9 second dose once you are done with the first dose of vaccine you will receive an sms with the date for your second dose make sure to repeat the above steps and get the second dose to ensure complete protection against covid19 what to do after getting the vaccine once you have gotten your dose there are some things to keep in mind after getting the covid vaccine 1) after the first dose stay at the vaccination centre for 1530 minutes after you receive the dose so healthcare workers can monitor your reaction check when you need to get the second dose as it is different for each vaccine make sure your first dose has been updated on cowin you can take painkillers or paracetamol to deal with any side effects of the vaccine 2) after the second dose once again you will have to remain for monitoring for at least 1530 minutes ensure that the second dose has been updated on cowin (it should say that you are fully vaccinated) download the vaccination certificate from the cowin portal for proof of vaccination you may feel more intense side effects after your second dose than the first time so once again keep painkillers and paracetamol handy to deal with them what are the side effects of taking the covid vaccine when you take the covid19 vaccine you might experience some minor side effects however it is very important to remember that this is not any cause for concern the side effects just indicate that your body is building up immunity to protect against covid19 and they will go away within a few days these side effects include pain at the injection site fatigue and body ache headache muscle and joint pain rashes abdominal pain nausea chills fever in case the pain at the injection site increases after 24 hours or if you feel that the other side effects are not going away after a few days contact your doctor also please keep in mind that those who experience immediate and severe allergic reactions to the first dose of the covid19 vaccine should not receive the second dose who all are eligible for the covid19 vaccine as of may 1 2021 everyone above 18 years of age is eligible to get the vaccine in india however the availability of doses is based on stock in individual states and private hospitals do some people need to consult a doctor before getting the covid vaccine some people might need to consult with their doctors before registering for and getting the covid19 vaccine these people might include pregnant and lactating women while it is safe for most pregnant and lactating women to take the vaccine it is still important for them to consult with their gynaecologist and paediatrician before making any decision people with medical conditions those who have underlying medical conditions (or comorbidities) such as hypertension diabetes kidney illnesses or heart disease must consult their doctor and ask them whether it is safe to take the vaccine jab or not people who already have severe allergies if someone has a history of an anaphylactic or allergic reaction to vaccines injectable therapies pharmaceutical products or any food items they must talk to their doctor about whether or not they should get the vaccine those with autoimmune disorders people with such disorders (such as lupus multiple sclerosis guillainbarre syndrome or psoriasis) already have sensitive immune systems so they need to check with their doctors if the vaccine can worsen their conditions

monitoring for at least 1530 minutes ensure that the second dose has been updated on cowin (it should say that you are fully vaccinated) download the vaccination certificate from the cowin portal for proof of vaccination you may feel more intense side effects after your second dose than the first time so once again keep painkillers and paracetamol handy to deal with them what are the side effects of taking the covid vaccine when you take the covid19 vaccine you might experience some minor side effects however it is very important to remember that this is not any cause for concern the side effects just indicate that your body is building up immunity to protect against covid19 and they will go away within a few days these side effects include pain at the injection site fatigue and body ache headache muscle and joint pain rashes abdominal pain nausea chills fever in case the pain at the injection site increases after 24 hours or if you feel that the other side effects are not going away after a few days contact your doctor also please keep in mind that those who experience immediate and severe allergic reactions to the first dose of the covid19 vaccine should not receive the second dose who all are eligible for the covid19 vaccine as of may 1 2021 everyone above 18 years of age is eligible to get the vaccine in india however the availability of doses is based on stock in individual states and private hospitals do some people need to consult a doctor before getting the covid vaccine some people might need to consult with their doctors before registering for and getting the covid19 vaccine these people might include pregnant and lactating women  while it is safe for most pregnant and lactating women to take the vaccine it is still important for them to consult with their gynaecologist and paediatrician before making any decision people with medical conditions  those who have underlying medical conditions (or comorbidities) such as hypertension diabetes kidney illnesses or heart disease must consult their doctor and ask them whether it is safe to take the vaccine jab or not people who already have severe allergies  if someone has a history of an anaphylactic or allergic reaction to vaccines injectable therapies pharmaceutical products or any food items they must talk to their doctor about whether or not they should get the vaccine those with autoimmune disorders  people with such disorders (such as lupus multiple sclerosis guillainbarre syndrome or psoriasis) already have sensitive immune systems so they need to check with their doctors if the vaccine can worsen their conditions																
156	1	Statement for healthcare professionals how covid19 vaccines are regulated for safety and effectiveness joint statement from the international coalition of medicines regulatory authorities and world health organization 17 may 2022 statement reading time 16 min (4294 words)   francais  espanol healthcare professionals and public health authorities have a central role in discussing vaccination against covid19 with their patients vaccines play a critical role in preventing deaths hospitalisation caused by infectious diseases emerging data on effectiveness indicates that licenced covid19vaccines are contributing to controlling the spread of the disease until widespread vaccination has been achieved both vaccinated and unvaccinated people need to be aware of the additional protective behaviours required to control the pandemic locally the global impact of the covid19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented level of public interest in vaccines this includes a focus on the development of vaccines and their regulatory review and safety monitoring much of this coverage has taken place through mass and social media reports of adverse events (side effects) have led some people to express concerns about getting vaccinated delay getting vaccinated or even be strongly opposed to vaccination there are also differences in individual confidence in national safety monitoring systems another challenge in communicating the importance of covid19 vaccination is that younger adults are typically less clinically affected by covid19 infection and so may see limited value in getting vaccinated including until further data confirms that vaccines prevent transmission and that vaccines are effective against variants clear and consistent communication is therefore essential to support people in making the choice to be vaccinated we appreciate that you your colleagues and your patients may have a number of questions around the development regulatory review and ongoing safety monitoring of covid19 vaccines purpose this joint international coalition of medicines regulatory authorities (icmra)* and who statement aims to help healthcare professionals answer questions about the role of regulators in the oversight of covid19 vaccines it explains how vaccines undergo robust scientific evaluation to determine their safety efficacy and quality and how safety is closely and continually monitored after approval vaccination has been shown to contribute to reducing deaths and severe illness from covid19 and to reduce the transmission of covid19 vaccinating as many people as possible and reducing the spread of disease is important vaccination of a significant proportion of the population also protects vulnerable people including those who cannot receive vaccines or the small proportion of people who might remain at risk of infection after vaccination failure to vaccinate widely also enables continued circulation of the virus and the generation of variants including some that may pose a greater risk widespread vaccination will help prevent people from having to go to hospital and contribute to fewer people getting sick ultimately alleviating the burden of covid19 on healthcare systems it will also help allow a return to normal societal functioning and the reopening of economies vaccines and the regulatory process how do regulatory authorities evaluate covid19 vaccines regulators rigorously evaluate scientific and clinical evidence provided by vaccine manufacturers vaccine manufactures are legally obliged to follow defined standards in the data they provide and their clinical research and manufacturing operations are subject to regulatory oversight either full or summary data from clinical trials is made available following vaccine evaluation each vaccine is thoroughly assessed for safety efficacy and pharmaceutical quality to determine whether it can be approved for use regulators use available scientific evidence from preclinical laboratory research human clinical trials and manufacturing information to assess benefits and risks of candidate vaccines regulators may seek additional expert advice from independent scientific advisory committees to help inform their decision on whether to approve a vaccine these committees are made up of experts in science medicine (including infectious diseases) and public health and often include consumer and healthcare professional representatives public health agencies have a different role than regulatory authorities they develop and deliver vaccination programmes often working with their expert immunisation technical advisory committees this includes prioritising and designating populations for vaccination with specific vaccines issuing additional recommendations and providing information more broadly about vaccines and immunization they also collaborate with regulators to monitor the safety of vaccines after they are approved for use globally the public can have confidence in the rigour of the process used to scientifically evaluate the safety efficacy and quality of vaccines before they are approved for use in the wider population safety evidence prior to potential regulatory authorisation safety evidence is an essential part of each regulatory submission for a covid19 vaccine it is gathered during all phases of the vaccine development process robust assessment of safety is carried out in the clinical trials and submitted to regulators for review as part of the approval process all adverse events need to be examined and reported in the regulatory submission by the companies for a marketing licence typically regulators will require that participants in clinical trials have been followed for at least 12 months after receiving their final vaccine dose generally based on previous experience with vaccines most adverse events occur within such timeframes though rare adverse events might not be recognised until after wide population use there will also be longerterm (for example for 612 months or more) followup of those who participated in the earlier phases of the clinical trials of each vaccine many trial participants will also be followed for at least one year to assess the duration of protection and longerterm safety of individual vaccines and safety data from these longerterm trials will be carefully reviewed by regulators as part of postapproval monitoring of safety efficacy apart from information on the types of immune responses induced by the vaccine companies must submit data from welldesigned clinical trials to regulators to demonstrate that the vaccine prevents covid19 the data showed there were sufficient numbers of people included in the clinical trials receiving the vaccine so that the efficacy of the vaccine can be accurately measured (generally at least 10 000 and usually 15 000 or more people who receive the vaccine in addition to those in the control arm) populations in clinical trials should include a range of age groups and people with comorbidities given the disproportionate impact of covid19 on older people covid19 vaccine clinical trials have included significant numbers of older participants vaccine clinical trials for a new candidate vaccine showed that vaccines very significantly reduced covid19 in people who were vaccinated compared to a control group of people who did not receive the vaccine through a reduction in numbers of laboratory confirmed sarscov2 infections quality any covid19 vaccine that receives regulatory authorisation must be manufactured according to internationally accepted stringent regulatory standards of good manufacturing practices (gmp) regulators review data to confirm that the manufacturing process at each production site is wellcontrolled and consistent this will include data on the composition and purity of the vaccine and its potency as well as data on every step of manufacturing and on the controls used to ensure that each batch of vaccine is consistently of a high quality data on vaccine stability must also be provided before a vaccine can be approved after approval batches may also undergo evaluation by individual national regulatory authorities to ensure they meet national requirements before they can be supplied monitoring safety and effectiveness after vaccine approval after a vaccine is approved for use regulators conduct robust effectiveness monitoring as well as monitoring of safety and risk minimisation activities (pharmacovigilance) they need to continuously monitor vaccine safety to ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks regulators do this by reviewing and analysing adverse events reported by healthcare professionals and consumers and requiring industry vaccine companies (sometimes called sponsors) to report to regulators on adverse events received both within the regulators home country and globally many regulators will implement enhanced passive surveillance systems these include systems to rapidly compare numbers of suspected side effects reported with vaccines to the numbers of events expected to occur by chance and include access to near realtime data on vaccine usage in different settings several regulators also implemented traceability systems for different vaccine brands and batches taking rapid action to mitigate risks also considering the information about emerging safety issues shared among regulators and researchers through international collaboration reviewing medical literature and other sources of new safety information requiring vaccine manufacturers to continue safety surveillance from the ongoing clinical trials of their products and many regulators also require vaccine manufacturers to have risk management plans describing how they will monitor and minimise risks including further epidemiological studies associated with their vaccines it is very important that healthcare professionals not only diligently report any adverse events they see in their patients but also encourage people who are vaccinated to immediately report adverse events to their healthcare professionals or to the medicines regulator in countries where direct reports from members of the public are accepted by the regulator reporting all relevant events helps regulators assess the possible role of the vaccine in causing the adverse event and assists in identifying safety issues relating to newly introduced vaccines as part of the safety monitoring and review of all suspected side effects reporting for vaccines regulators have developed lists of adverse events of special interest these lists include some events that have been associated with other vaccines (for example anaphylaxis) others are included on these lists because they are serious events that are important to monitor extremely closely even though there is no evidence that they are causally associated with specific vaccines having information on the background rates of these events that would be expected in people who have not received a vaccine will help ensure that any increased reporting of these events can be quickly detected and thoroughly investigated by regulators the widespread use of covid19 vaccines including in the elderly and in patients with underlying health conditions will unfortunately mean that there will be deaths and serious illnesses that are purely coincidental and unrelated to vaccinations the job of each regulator together with the relevant medical experts and vaccine manufacturers is to determine causality there will be a special focus on monitoring safety in some groups of people such as pregnant women persons with severe preexisting illness older people children and in people also receiving vaccines for prevention of other diseases regulators often in collaboration with public health authorities are able to take decisive action if a safety issue is identified these actions might include issuing safety communications for patients healthcare professionals and the community updating the product information or consumer information for the vaccine preventing the release of a particular batch of vaccine and taking other regulatory actions such as restriction of vaccine authorisation to a particular subgroup of the community or revocation of authorisation commonly reported adverse events the most commonlyreported events with covid19 vaccines are expected vaccine side effects such as headache fatigue muscle and joint pain fever and chills and pain at the site of injection the occurrence of these adverse events is consistent with what is already known about the vaccines from clinical trials adverse events of special interest regulators approve and maintain an approval of a vaccine only if they determine that the known and potential benefits of the vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks anaphylaxis is a very rare side effect that may occur with any vaccine there have been some other reported adverse events which include facial weakness seizures loss of sense of taste or small and cardiac events but none are confirmed to be causally related to the vaccines mrna vaccines the major adverse event of special interest reported for these vaccines which include the pfizer and moderna vaccines is anaphylaxis regulators carefully review the reports of possible anaphylaxis to determine whether they are consistent with true anaphylaxis and whether they may have been caused by the vaccine anaphylaxis reports remains very rare (in the order of 10 cases per million vaccinated) guidance on the management of possible anaphylaxis is included in the product information/label for these vaccines routine vaccination procedures include keeping people under observation for at least 15 minutes after vaccination and having appropriate medical treatment on hand so that anaphylaxis can be rapidly managed these vaccines should not be given to people with a known history of a severe allergic reaction to any of the vaccine components a second dose of mrna vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose there have been some other reported adverse events which include unusual bleeding and blood clotting disorders facial weakness seizures loss of sense of taste or smell and cardiac events regulators monitor and carefully review if there is a causal relationship between the vaccines with those adverse events and if appropriate they will be included in product information / product label of vaccines of concern adenovirus vector vaccines these include the astrazeneca janssen gamaleya and cansino biologics vaccines internationally the astrazeneca and janssen covid19 vaccines have been associated with a very rare and unusual clotting syndrome involving thromboembolic events (blood clots) with thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count) this condition has been termed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts) medicines regulators are meeting regularly to share information about cases to better characterise this risk and understand this syndrome less information is available internationally about adverse events following the gamaleya and cansino biologics vaccines the overall number of reports received of blood clots in the veins or arteries (including venous thrombosis or venous thromboembolism) occurring without thrombocytopenia is no higher than the expected background population rate for the more common type of blood clots in most countries the spontaneous reporting rates of thromboembolic events with thrombocytopenia vary by country and the precise incidences are difficult to estimate but for the astrazeneca vaccine based on substantial use in europe and the uk the frequency of such events is very rare available estimates are of the order of 1015 per million people vaccinated (note that for some countries this statistic is based on the numbers of reports of suspected cases of tts rather than numbers of confirmed cases) thromboembolic events with thrombocytopenia have also been reported in the united states for the janssen vaccine at a rate of about 23 per million doses administered national regulators are continuing to monitor the issue closely and to publish up to date information on the numbers of cases reported and the latest estimates of the incidence the cases of thromboembolic events with thrombocytopenia after vaccination were mainly reported for younger rather than older individuals this together with the risk of serious illness or death associated with covid19 being much higher in middleaged and older people has led public health authorities in some countries to recommend that vaccination with the astra zeneca vaccine not be initiated in younger individuals healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia as well as coagulopathies after vaccination as tts requires specific management vaccinated individuals should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms such as a severe or persistent headache blurred vision shortness of breath chest pain leg swelling persistent abdominal pain or unusual skin bruising and/or petechiae (tiny purple red or brown spots on the skin) mostly occurring within around 420 days after vaccination although some cases have been reported later than 20 days post vaccination this information is in the product information / product label of the vaccines as approved by regulators questions and answers on covid19 vaccines q how have the vaccines been developed so quickly does this mean that their safety and efficacy has been compromised a the speed of development of covid19 vaccines has been unprecedented for several reasons but the safety and efficacy requirements for vaccines have not been compromised vaccine development was facilitated by the massive financial investment by governments industry and philanthropic organisations in vaccine development and the redirection of much of the global research and commercial infrastructure for the development and manufacture of vaccines governments also enabled companies to take the commercial risk of manufacturing some vaccine stocks ahead of regulatory approvals new technologies adapted from the development of other vaccines  mrna vaccines were developed for covid19 very rapidly after the sequence of the covid19 virus was determined but the underlying technology had been under development since much longer and production could be scaled up very quickly the adenovirus technology used for adenovirus vector vaccines was first tested with sars mers and ebola virus over the last 20 years and so was able to be adapted quickly to covid19 which has several similarities to these viruses clinical trial successes  it has been possible to rapidly recruit large numbers of volunteers into clinical trials and with unfortunately high rates of infection in several countries to complete trials with 1000050000 people in a short period of time under normal circumstances it may take many months or even a few years to carry out trials of this size to determine whether a vaccine is effective very close collaboration  between regulators industry and clinical researchers enabled clear indications of regulatory requirements and early access to results intensive and insightful research  researchers predicted that the spike protein on the virus would be a good target for vaccine development and almost all vaccines have been designed to induce a response to this protein so far the spike protein has produced a strong immune response in those vaccinated and for those vaccines that have reported clinical results are highly protective from covid19 disease q will mrna vaccines affect the dna of vaccine recipients a no the mrna in the vaccine has not been shown to incorporate itself into the genes of vaccine recipients and breaks down in the weeks after vaccination mrna vaccines contain genetic instructions for our cells which only read them and provide copies of the sarscov2 spike protein this enables the bodys natural immune systems to cause a response in vaccine recipients if they are later exposed to the virus q how long will covid19 vaccination provide protection for immunised people a we do not yet know how long protection from any of these vaccines lasts we will get better insights over the next 12 months the duration of protection provided by vaccines can vary for example the seasonal influenza vaccine is given annually because the influenza virus mutates and protection wanes over a number of months other vaccines such as those for rubella or measles provide multiyear or even lifelong protection from disease mutations in key viral proteins can mean that virus variants emerge the sarscov2coronavirus is prone to mutations that creates variants some of which have become established in a number of regions of the world the scientific community and regulators are very actively monitoring whether the current vaccines can continue protecting people from infection with new variants a number of vaccine developers are currently developing vaccines against the range of variants and it is likely that booster shots with these vaccines will increase protection against known variants regulators have agreed that review of data on vaccines against variants will be facilitated based on assessment of immune response to the variant in the same way that new seasonal influenza vaccines are evaluated each year q why are there so many vaccine candidates a as the global seriousness of the pandemic became rapidly apparent development of effective vaccines for covid19 became the top priority of many pharmaceutical companies and medical research institutes there was also unprecedented government and private sector investment in vaccine development there is now a wide range of technologies for developing new vaccines  and many of the organisations developing covid19 vaccines have particular experience in one or more of these technologies this has ensured that there would still be vaccines available if some were not approved for reasons of efficacy safety or manufacturing challenges q what if many people start getting a reaction from a particular covid19 vaccine a shortterm reactions such as soreness at the injection site fatigue or headache are common following any vaccination with covid19 vaccines these reactions usually pass in a day or two if new evidence becomes available that suggests that a specific serious adverse event may be linked to a particular covid19 vaccine then regulators will take action working collaboratively on a global basis and liaise with public health authorities the type of actions that can be taken depend on the nature of the adverse event and could range from issuing safety warnings for patients healthcare professionals and the community updating the product information or consumer information for the vaccine to show contraindications for the use in particular patients (eg those with certain comorbidities) to closely monitoring adverse events in certain groups of patients preventing the release of a particular batch of vaccine through to temporary suspension of the use of the vaccine until more is known q how are regulators speeding up the time it takes to authorise a covid19 vaccine a many regulators globally have implemented faster access pathways for covid19 vaccines without compromising on strict standards of safety quality and efficacy some countries have emergency use authorisation pathways which assess the available data at the time of authorisation exercising these provisions is a matter for those countries taking into account the benefits versus risks in the context of the prevailing domestic pandemic situation different countries may coin this pathway or authorisation routes differently but essentially they follow the same principles other countries have implemented accelerated/priority conditional or provisional approval schemes under normal circumstances regulatory assessment begins once all information to support registration is available for covid19 vaccines many regulators have agreed to accept data on a rolling basis to enable early evaluation of data as it becomes available regulators will only be in a position to make a provisional approval decision for a vaccine once there is sufficient data to support adequately the safety quality and effectiveness of the vaccine for its intended use if a decision is made to grant provisional or conditional approval it will be based on the requirement for the sponsor to submit more comprehensive longer term clinical data stability data and other information with agreed timelines q did our country approve this covid19 vaccine or are we relying on another countrys approval a most countries are carrying out independent regulatory evaluations on the submitted data for each vaccine however to ensure a more efficient use of resources and expertise regulators in different countries are communicating closely on safety efficacy and quality data and discussing technical issues as they may arise in many cases principles of who good reliance practices and collaborative mechanisms leverage the output of other regulators q why werent very rare blood clots with low platelets with the astrazeneca or janssen vaccines picked up during clinical trials a thromboembolic events with concurrent thrombocytopenia are very rare  with estimates based on the number of spontaneous reports suggesting an overall incidence on the order of 1015 cases per million doses the clinical trials of these vaccines included large numbers of people often with 10000 to 20000 individuals in the active vaccine arms but even in trials of this size it was statistically unlikely that such very rare events would be detected this shows the importance of continual safety monitoring during the use of these vaccines to allow very rare events to be detected

160	1	Benefits of getting the covid19 vaccine know the facts so you can make the best decision by venus sanchez there is a lot of concern over whether or not one should get the covid19 vaccine with the number of deaths and infections rising it is hard to come up with a good reason not to nevertheless there is a slew of misinformation circulating around the world it is important to do our research and gather all of the facts in order to make an informed decision part of making an informed decision means weighing the pros and cons its true that all vaccines come with some risk however negative reactions are extremely rare plus all of the vaccines have undergone rigorous clinical trials in order to prove they are safe and effective benefits of the covid19 vaccine benefit #1 preventing disease and mortality the covid19 vaccine may lower your risk of getting covid19 even if you do get sick with covid19 youll most likely get a very mild version of it among people who have already gotten the vaccine hospitalizations and deaths have been almost nonexistent tests show that the vaccines on the market are 94 to 95 percent effective which are some of the best numbers ever seen for vaccines benefit #2 reducing the risk to others say you get the covid19 vaccine but you later test positive for the infection you will likely have a milder form of the disease with fewer (or no) symptoms when this happens you will likely shed fewer virus particles a lower viral load (the amount of virus in someones blood) often results in a milder infectionor no infection at all to put it another way your vaccination may help protect others from serious covid19 benefit #3 reaching herd immunity safely the covid19 vaccine will promote herd immunity this is where enough people have the antibodies to the virus so the infection has nowhere to spread there are two ways to achieve herd immunity naturally or with a vaccine natural herd immunity is when everyone simply gets the disease the reason vaccination is better is because covid19 can have serious complications and there is no way to know how it will affect a person covid19 could kill you whereas the vaccine may just cause mild side effects in other words herd immunity by vaccination is much safer than letting everyone have covid19 itself benefit #4 getting back to normal life when more people are vaccinated covid19 cases should start to drop returning to normal might not be immediate even after the vaccine people will still need to wear their masks for a while however once cases start to fall masks may be able to come off youll be able to attend concerts and festivals again and you wont have to worry about when you can see your family again

162	1	The pandemic has been one of the greatest health crises in recorded history thanks to rapid advances in science and technology the light at the end of the tunnel is getting closer major vaccination efforts are currently underway to immunize the worlds population according to data from health authorities compiled by our world in data 397% of the worlds population has received at least one dose while as of today almost 21 billion people across the globe are fully vaccinated listen to audio leer en espanol there are many theories surrounding covid19 vaccination however the world health organization (who) and expert health authorities around the world are urging people to get vaccinated as the best solution to end the pandemic the sooner people are immunized the faster it will be possible not only to slow the spread of the disease but also to limit its impact on the economy the benefits of vaccination according to the who vaccination is a simple safe and effective way to protect against harmful diseases before coming into contact with them as it activates the bodys natural defenses to learn to resist specific infections and strengthen the immune system in this sense vaccination against covid19 will reduce the risk of becoming seriously ill and dying since the person will be better protected immunity will not be 100% since a vaccinated person can still catch the disease however the consequences for the body are expected to be much less the main benefits are covid19 vaccines can also prevent you from becoming seriously ill even if you contract the virus tall covid19 vaccines are safe and effective by getting vaccinated yourself you also protect the people around you it is a safer way to develop immunity accordingly leading organizations such as the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) of the united states state on their website that the vaccines are safe they highlight three main points vaccines were developed based on scientific knowledge used for decades they are not experimental they went through all the required stages of clinical trials extensive testing and monitoring have shown these vaccines to be safe and effective covid19 vaccines have undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in history vaccination around the world worldwide more than 319 billion doses of coronavirus vaccine have been administered so far according to figures compiled by our world in data according to these figures almost 27% of the worlds population has had both doses (approximately 21 billion people) by country china leads the global tally with more than two billion vaccines followed by india with more than 632 million doses administered these countries are followed by western nations such as the united states which has administered 368 million injections brazil with more than 187 million and turkey with 93 million																
163	1	What are the benefits of being vaccinated for covid19 feeling some anxiety about receiving any new vaccine is understandable however while the covid19 vaccine was created and approved more quickly than the average vaccine safety and testing precautions were not sacrificed to achieve effective results covid19 is a highly infectious and in some cases highly dangerous disease some populations including the elderly and persons with underlying medical conditions (ie comorbidities) are at greater risk for severe symptoms and even death natural immunity combined with vaccineinduced immunity appears to be the most effective means of safeguarding against covid19 advantages of vaccination heres how a covid19 vaccination benefits you protection against covid19 the best means of staying healthy is to avoid infection by the sarscov2 virus if however you do become infected vaccination appears to limit the risk of developing severe or even fatal symptoms this is because the currently available vaccine primes your immunological system for producing antibodies without causing you to get sick if you do become infected your body is prepared to fight the disease vaccination typically results in fewer or milder symptoms when youre ill (or no symptoms at all) protection for your family and friends by getting the covid19 vaccine you also lessen the chance of spreading the covid19 pathogen to family members friends or other people with whom you have contact high rates of effectiveness all fdaapproved medications are clinically tested before release to the public the pfizerbiontech vaccine has been shown to be 9495 percent effective within two weeks of full inoculation against the original strand of the covid19 virus vaccines also show high numbers of efficacy protecting people from serious illness from covid19 variants as with any vaccination some side effects have been recorded these include soreness at the injection site headaches chills fever and fatigue in the great majority of cases these postinoculation symptoms will disappear quickly they are also far less severe than the most serious covid19 symptoms vaccination and public health safety measures the availability of vaccines does not decrease the need for safety measures to help beat the covid19 pandemic even after inoculation you should practice good personal hygiene including frequent handwashing wear a face mask in public practice social distancing avoid prolonged contact with crowds indoors or out the ultimate defeat of covid19 requires every tool available vaccination natural immunity and effective public health measures,																
164	1	What are the benefits of getting the covid19 vaccine photo of person being vaccinated although experts are still learning a lot about the covid19 vaccines there are some clear benefits to getting vaccinated if youve already received the vaccine great job share these facts with others who might be hesitant if youre unsure whether the vaccine is right for you consider these four benefits the vaccine could provide you and your loved ones the vaccine reduces your risk of infection once you receive your first shot your body begins producing antibodies to the coronavirus these antibodies help your immune system fight the virus if you happen to be exposed so it reduces your chance of getting the disease there are three vaccines available for use in the united states and they are all effective in preventing infection learn more about effectiveness its true that you can still become infected after being vaccinated but once more of the population is vaccinated those chances are further reduced thanks to something called herd immunity so getting vaccinated not only reduces your chance of being infected it also contributes to community protection reducing the likelihood of virus transmission the vaccine can help your unborn baby or newborn studies have found that expectant mothers who receive the covid19 vaccine create antibodies to the virus and pass those to their unborn baby through the placenta mothers were also shown to pass antibodies to their newborns through breast milk this suggests those newborns have some immunity to the virus which is especially important as young children cannot get the vaccine learn more about vaccine considerations for pregnant and nursing women the vaccine protects against severe illness during studies the three vaccines  johnson & johnson moderna and pfizer  have shown to be effective at preventing severe illness from covid19 so if you are vaccinated and become infected you are very unlikely to become severely ill the cdc tracks confirmed covid19 hospitalizations by vaccination status for adults 18 and older unvaccinated people were eight times more likely to be hospitalized than fully vaccinated people among adolescents between ages 1217 unvaccinated people are 10 times more likely to be hospitalized than fully vaccinated people																
165	1	Five benefits of getting a covid19 vaccine by brianna hoge may 07 2021 print email editors note the information published in this story is accurate at the time of publication always refer to uabedu/uabunited for uabs current guidelines and recommendations relating to covid19 close up of a young man getting vaccinatedwith more people becoming eligible to receive a covid19 vaccine some may be wondering why they should get vaccinated university of alabama at birmingham experts explain five benefits you could experience by getting one of the three vaccines available you can attend small events in person in april the centers for disease control and prevention updated their guidance on small public gatherings for fully vaccinated individuals small gatherings in a home or private setting with other fully vaccinated people are safe however large public events such as sporting events and concerts are still not recommended for fully vaccinated people it is safe to gather with other small groups without a mask inside a home or private setting although medium and large gatherings are not recommended at this time even if everyone is fully vaccinated said rachael lee md assistant professor in the uab division of infectious diseases to see the return of such events suzanne judd phd professor in the uab school of public health says we must reach herd immunity large public events can return but only once 70 percent of the population is vaccinated judd said israel has vaccinated 80 percent of their adult population and has been able to start returning back to the ways things were before the pandemic what does fully vaccinated mean according to the cdc people are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after they received their second shot of the pfizer or moderna vaccine or the single dose of the johnson & johnson vaccine you can travel a second benefit to getting vaccinated is fully vaccinated people can travel without quarantining both domestically and internationally however outside of the home setting i recommend continuing to wear masks to prevent transmission of covid19 particularly given the rise of covid variants of concern that may bypass our immune system lee said you can reconnect with loved ones and coworkers another benefit to getting vaccinated is families could feel comfortable gathering again sharing meals and enjoying each others company grandparents may see grandchildren again and people who have health concerns or are undergoing cancer therapy may be able to get out and see friends which could really help to boost their mood judd said with more americans being vaccinated every day the reconnecting could be more than just family many companies are allowing their employees to return to the office allowing coworkers to reconnect after many months you could see immediate health benefits receiving a covid19 vaccine can decrease the chances of catching covid19 by a remarkable percentage judd notes that getting a vaccine is much more likely to protect ones health than masking or social distancing the clinical trial data has demonstrated the vaccines reduce the rate of covid by 90 percent that is huge judd said our best interventions to slow case transmission in 2020 were social interventions like masking and distancing which resulted in only a 20 percent to 60 percent reduction in covid depending on where and how implemented vax flyer1stopping the spread of covid means slowing mutations of the virus too every time the virus spreads to a new person it has the chance to mutate the vaccine gives us a much better chance at getting covid case levels to a manageable level so we could see more places reopen and see the restrictions lessen according to the cdc if a person is exposed to the coronavirus or a mutation of it a fully vaccinated person  two weeks after the second shot of pfizer or moderna or single dose of the johnson & johnson vaccine  is 94 percent less likely to be hospitalized compared to an unvaccinated individual in addition to having a significantly lower risk of catching covid a vaccine could help reduce longterm symptoms if you have already had covid19 according to judd health professionals are hearing that some people with lingering covid symptoms see easing of symptoms following vaccination longterm benefits researchers have yet to determine what all the longterm consequences of covid could be even for those who had a mild case and were not hospitalized judd observes that previous infectious diseases caused health problems after many years a good example of this is chicken pox judd said many of us in our 40s and beyond had chicken pox while our children were given the varicella vaccine those of us who had chicken pox are at risk of shingles while those who had the vaccine seem to be at lower risk for shingles even though we lived through chicken pox with only a few scars there are longterm consequences to the infection in terms of risk of shingles she said the same may be true for covid given that we have no idea what future risks may occur from having had a covid infection that is a huge risk for an individual to take with their health uab now offers vaccines at all four of its community vaccination locations with no appointment necessary those who wish to make appointments for specific dates and times may do so at

166	1	Myths vs facts making sense of covid19 vaccine misinformation when so much wrong information is readily available convincing people to get vaccinated has proven to be a huge challenge august 13 2021 166 doug most myth pronounced mith noun definition a widely held but false belief or idea synonyms misconception fallacy fantasy fiction among the many reasons covid19 vaccination rates in the united states peaked earlier than experts hopedthen rather than crescendoing into the summer months began trending downwardare myths that took hold among the unvaccinated and solidified as their reasons not to get the shots the vaccine will make women sterile the vaccines are too new the shots have a microchip in them the vaccine itself will give me covid im immune because i had covid breakthrough cases prove vaccines are useless there are more and none of them are true but no matter how convincing and irrefutable the science and the data about the covid19 vaccines are misinformation spreads so easily and quicklylargely through social media networksthat it has become a major barrier stopping the united states from reaching higher levels of vaccination (190 million people or 57 percent of americans have received at least one shot) that would bring us closer to herd immunity so lets cut to the chase myth vs fact the brink took some of the most widespread myths to two leading infectious disease experts davidson hamer a faculty member of bus school of public health school of medicine and national emerging infectious diseases laboratories and sabrina assoumou a bu school of medicine assistant professor of medicine and of infectious diseases and a boston medical center physician if these two experts encountered someone on the street who cited one of these myths as their reason not to get vaccinated this is what they would say to them to provide extra context we include one more fact myth the covid vaccines were not rigorously tested which is why they have only emergency authorization approval and not full food and drug administration approval (update pfizers vaccine received full fda approval on august 19) fact vaccine developers didnt skip any testing steps but conducted some of the steps on an overlapping schedule to gather data fasterjohns hopkins medicine assoumou this is the most common question i get asked i think there is a perception that things moved very fast but we want to underscore that the technology being used now was being studied for a decade the main difference between emergency use versus full fda approval is that you need two months of monitoring rather than six months when you look at the history of vaccines if patients were to develop side effects these occurred within two months we are now over six months into our experience with these vaccines we have not seen anything that would make us believe that the risks outweigh the benefits and vaccines have saved so many lives hamer the development was more rapid than many other vaccines but it used the same process of phase one and phase two trials following appropriate safety measures stage three trials were largescale trials done rigorously with very clear outcome definitions the safety measures and approaches taken are standard for clinical trials they just did it more rapidly than usual the full process review is ongoing and we are already hearing that pfizer will have full fda authorization by september and moderna soon after myth the technology used to create the covid vaccines is too new to be safe fact the technology used called messenger rna or mrna is not new research on it actually began in the early 1990s and two diseases that are very close to covidsars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003 and mers (middle east respiratory syndrome)helped bring the mrna vaccine development to present day usecenters for disease control and prevention understanding mrna covid19 vaccines assoumou the reason this is called sarscov2 is that there was a sars1 the original one and scientists were working on this vaccine so when this pandemic arrived they had already developed a lot of the science a decade of work was actually going on thats one issue i like to emphasize when people think it was rushed the other point i like to remind people is that these vaccines went through all the regulatory steps like any other vaccines none of this was rushed the fda reviewed all the data when you say emergency use people think it was rushed but the way to think about it is that the benefits outweigh the risks myth breakthrough cases prove that even if i get the vaccine i might still get covid so why bother fact as of august 9 the cdc said there had been 8054 vaccinated people who were hospitalized or died who had also tested positive for coronavirusout of more than 166 million fully vaccinated americans thats roughly 005 percent additionally cdc director rochelle walensky has said that 995 percent of all deaths from covid19 are in the unvaccinatedpolitifact fact checking joe bidens figure on unvaccinated covid19 deaths hamer covid vaccines have been shown to be very powerful in preventing more severe disease and the need for hospitalization breakthroughs occur at a much much lower rate than in people who are unvaccinated the breakthroughs have been occurring more frequently with the delta variant because of the high level of infectiousness (or transmissibility) of the delta variant and lower protection of current vaccines against this variant but people having breakthroughs have much more mild infection more like an upper respiratory infection the vaccines prevent severe disease and complications and allow people to return to a more normal state assoumou i was just at the hospital taking care of patients i can tell you all the cases of people getting hospitalized are unvaccinated breakthrough cases account for much less than 1 percent there are so many zeros before the one99 percent of people dying now of covid are unvaccinated and 97 percent of those hospitalized are unvaccinated we are just not seeing large numbers of people vaccinated being hospitalized and if you get it for the most part it is like having a cold myth the covid vaccines can affect a womans fertility fact this rumor started after a report claimed inaccurately yet circulated on social media that the spike protein on this coronavirus was the same as another protein called syncytin1 that is involved in the growth and attachment of the placenta during pregnancy it was quickly debunked as false by the scientific communitystat news shattering the infertility myth hamer i think people were worried that the messenger rna in these vaccines messes with their genes it doesnt it doesnt even make it into the nucleus of your cells it wont intervene with any metabolic activity assoumou ohh this is so common that i hear this for young women of childbearing age its a common question it started with a report that was incorrect and has been debunked but unfortunately once the information gets out there the correct information doesnt always come through i tell people that when we look at the mechanism by which these vaccines work we see that they simply dont impact fertility myth i already had covid therefore i dont need the vaccine im immune fact after people recover from infection with a virus the immune system retains a memory of it the national institutes of health explains while thats good for the immune system it also means that even after you recover from covid its still inside your body and can resurface studies have been unclear how long immunity lasts after having covidmost experts believe anywhere from 90 days to six months though it could be longernational institutes of health assoumou thats a very common one the information we have right now is that vaccines provide a more broadbased immune response that will protect you for a longer period of time with the mrna vaccines you have two shots one to prime and then another one to boost the immune system you need the boost to protect you for a longer period of time hamer after three to six months or so the natural immunity begins to wane and the risk of reinfection returns we are definitely seeing people develop reinfections receiving the vaccine after having covid is like a booster effect and therefore its much more effective studies have been done comparing those who had the disease versus those who did not and those who got at least one shot after having covid end up with very high levels of antibodies myth children do not need to be vaccinated because they do not become sick from covid19 fact hundreds of children in indonesia have died from the coronavirus in recent weeks many of them under age 5 a fiveyear old boy in the state of georgia died of coronavirus in julythe new york times  and cnn hamer children have much milder symptoms and are less likely to be hospitalized but since children can become infected and transmit the virus they can serve as an ongoing source of transmission everything seems to be changing with the delta variant it leads to a much higher viral load and that includes children assoumou thats a very common one it is true that children are not dying at the same rate as we are seeing in older adults but children are going to grow up to be adults we want to protect them as soon as possible in addition we are seeing some of the consequences of covid not only deaths but there is also multisystem inflammatory syndrome (misc) of children where children get very sick and we are still figuring out the details and longterm complications of this syndrome then there are emerging data that children are developing long covid [symptoms that linger] we have vaccines that are safe and effective in children 12 and above and were hoping well have it soon for younger kids also children are part of the herd when we talk about herd immunity we are referring to the level of immunity when the disease stops spreading in the community children are part of the population now that we have the delta variant were going to have to get to an even higher percentage of the population vaccinated to reach population level immunity children are part of the community it will be harder to get to some normalcy if a large proportion of the population remains unvaccinated myth im vaccinated so i can drop all my covid precautions right fact studies have shown that a person infected with the delta variant of covid has roughly 1000 times more copies of the virus in their respiratory tracts than a person infected with the original straincdc delta variant what we know about the science hamer the challenge is that delta is so transmissible that i am starting to advise people to wear masks again in supermarkets and stores and public places but delta is causing outbreaks mostly in unvaccinated people and only in some vaccinated people until we get to the point where transmission slows to a trickle delta is just more easily spread and we are quickly learning that it can easily lead to vaccine breakthroughs and even be spread from one vaccinated person to another assoumou the vaccines are safe and remarkably effective but what precautions to take will decide on a lot of factors for example where you live are you in a place with high vaccination coverage like massachusetts or a southern state with low vaccination coverage and high case rate it also depends on what activity you are engaging in outside not in a crowd thats safe you dont need a mask but inside in a crowd where you dont know who is vaccinated or unvaccinated then you may still want to follow public health measures if you have children less than 12 like i do then you also need to be a little more cautious in addition if you have a compromised immune system then you also need to take some precautions if you happen to be in a place with high vaccination coverage and a lower case rate then it might depend on your level of comfort for risk i do want to remind people there are still places we should mask up like the doctors office or on public transportation myth getting the covid vaccine actually gives you covid fact it is not medically possible the vaccine does not contain the virusjohns hopkins medicine hamer covid vaccines are not made with live virus sarscov2 virus cells they are not giving individuals the virus itself so you cant get covid from getting the vaccine myth a microchip with the backing of bill gates is being implanted with the vaccine fact this one started when microsoft cofounder gates said in an interview we will have some digital certificates that could ultimately show whos been tested and whos been vaccinated (alas he never mentioned microchips)bbc coronavirus bill gates microchip conspiracy theory,																
167	1	The covid19 vaccine myths vs facts a lab worker with covid19 vaccine many people are excited to have vaccines as the first step in managing the spread of coronavirus unfortunately there has been a lot of misinformation surrounding the vaccines and their development when deciding whether to get the vaccine its important to separate myths from facts myth the covid19 vaccine is unsafe because it was developed so quickly fact the vaccines are proven safe and effective although they were developed in record time they have gone through the same rigorous food and drug administration process as other vaccines meeting all safety standards no steps were skipped instead we can thank the unprecedented worldwide collaboration and investment for the shorter timeframe on the development of the vaccines the clinical trials and safety reviews actually took about the same amount of time as other vaccines myth the covid19 vaccine will alter my dna fact the first vaccines in use contain messenger rna (mrna) which instructs cells to make the spike protein found on the new coronavirus when the immune system recognizes this protein it builds an immune response by creating antibodies  teaching the body how to protect against future infection the mrna never enters the nucleus of the cell which is where our dna (genetic material) is kept the body gets rid of the mrna soon after its finished using the instructions myth the covid19 vaccine includes a tracking device fact a video shared thousands of times on facebook makes false claims about the products of syringe maker apiject systems of america which has a contract with the government to provide medicalgrade injection devices for vaccines the company has an optional version of its product that contains a microchip within the syringe label that helps providers confirm a vaccine doses origin the chip itself is not injected into the person getting the vaccine myth the covid19 vaccine has severe side effects such as allergic reactions fact some participants in the vaccine clinical trials did report side effects similar to those experienced with other vaccines including muscle pain chills and headache and although extremely rare people can have severe allergic reactions to ingredients used in a vaccine thats why experts recommend people with a history of severe allergic reactions  such as anaphylaxis  to the ingredients of the vaccine should not get the vaccination myth the covid19 vaccine causes infertility in women fact misinformation on social media suggests the vaccine trains the body to attack syncytin1 a protein in the placenta which could lead to infertility in women the truth is theres an amino acid sequence shared between the spike protein and a placental protein however experts say its too short to trigger an immune response and therefore doesnt affect fertility learn more myth ive already been diagnosed with covid19 so i dont need to receive the vaccine fact if you have already had covid19 theres evidence that you can still benefit from the vaccine at this time experts dont know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from covid19 the immunity someone gains from having an infection called natural immunity varies from person to person some early evidence suggests natural immunity may not last very long myth once i receive the covid19 vaccine i no longer need to wear a mask fact masking handwashing and physical distancing remain necessary in public until a sufficient number of people are immune fully vaccinated people can meet with other fully vaccinated people without wearing masks myth you can get covid19 from the vaccine fact you cannot get covid19 from the vaccine because it doesnt contain the live virus myth once i receive the vaccine i will test positive for covid19 fact viral tests used to diagnose covid19 check samples from the respiratory system for the presence of the virus that causes covid19 since there is no live virus in the vaccines the vaccines will not affect your test result it is possible to get infected with the virus before the vaccine has had time to fully protect your body myth im not at risk for severe complications of covid19 so i dont need the vaccine fact regardless of your risk you can still contract the infection and spread it to others so its important you get vaccinated once the vaccine is widely available its recommended that as many eligible adults as possible get the vaccine its not only to protect you but your family and community as well myth if i receive the covid19 vaccine i am at a greater risk to become sick from another illness fact there is no evidence to suggest that getting the vaccine heightens your risk to become sick from another infection such as the flu myth certain blood types have less severe covid19 infections so getting a vaccine isnt necessary truth research has shown there is no reason to believe being a certain blood type will lead to increased severity of covid19 by choosing to get vaccinated you are protecting not only yourself and your family but your community as well																
168	1	Covid19 vaccines safety side effects  and coincidence february 8 2021 by robert h shmerling md senior faculty editor harvard health publishing closeup photo of a row of vials of covid19 vaccine angling away from the camera and out of focus one vial is on its side with a syringe inserted into the top editors note on august 23 2021 the fda granted full approval to the pfizer/biontech covid19 vaccine for people ages 16 and older children ages 12 to 15 can continue to receive this vaccine under emergency use authorization as more data is collected as the pandemic rages on its increasingly clear that widespread vaccination is essential to help contain it physical distancing universal face coverings and frequent handwashing are effective but not foolproof and of course these measures dont work if they are not followed so the rapid development of mrna vaccines and other vaccines to prevent covid19 is welcome  some say miraculous  news but while many people are scrambling to get a vaccine others are hesitating start here are these vaccines safe and effective protect your brain from this feared medical problem that can be debilitating or even deadly whether youve already had a ministroke or a major stroke or have been warned that your high blood pressure might cause a future stroke harvard medical school experts distill the latest research and share advice that can help you prevent or cope with a stroke learn more view protect your brain from this feared medical problem that can be debilitating or even deadly its natural to wonder if brand new vaccines against a novel coronavirus developed at unprecedented speed are effective and safe to take lets review some of what we know overall effectiveness has been reported in the range of 70% to 95% thats well above the average effectiveness of the flu vaccine for example a pfizer/biontech vaccine trial involving nearly 44000 volunteers found vaccination to be 95% effective this vaccine is authorized for use in the us a moderna vaccine trial enrolling more than 30000 volunteers reported an effectiveness of 94% this vaccine is authorized for use in the us an astrazeneca/oxford vaccine trial reported average effectiveness of 70% with full doses but even better results (as high as 90%) with a lower dose this vaccine is authorized for use in great britain but not in the us a johnson & johnson (janssen) trial reported overall effectiveness of 66% (72% in the us) in preventing moderate to severe covid19 this vaccine is authorized for use in the us not only do these vaccines appear to lessen risk of developing covid19 but they also appear to lessen the risk of severe disease (click here for additional information on available vaccines) what are the most common covid vaccine side effects in large clinical trials most side effects have been minor when side effects occur they typically last just a few days a side effect or reaction isnt necessarily all bad by the way it may indicate that the body is building protection against the virus for the four vaccines listed above common side effects include pain at the site of the injection painful swollen lymph nodes in the arm where the vaccine was injected tiredness headache muscle or joint aches nausea and vomiting fever or chills what else should i know about possible side effects severe allergic reactions rarely a potentially lifethreatening reaction called anaphylaxis may occur most often in people known to have had severe vaccine reactions in the past cdc estimates suggest anaphylaxis occurs in 11 cases per million doses among people receiving the pfizer/biontech vaccine the signs are trouble breathing swelling of the face and throat rash and low blood pressure it usually occurs soon after vaccination and can be treated with epinephrine (as in an epipen) thats why people are observed for at least 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine with epinephrine at the ready unexplained deaths a recent report of 23 deaths among elderly vaccine recipients in norway raised understandable safety concerns about the new covid19 vaccines however further investigation is needed to determine whether these deaths were related to the vaccines or represent an expected number of deaths among frail individuals who already may have had a limited life expectancy pushing back on two vaccine misconceptions its normal to feel cautious about any new treatment but two common misconceptions may encourage people to avoid getting a covid vaccine health problems incorrectly blamed on the vaccine when health problems develop soon after vaccination people tend to blame the vaccine yet cancer strokes heart attacks blood disorders and rare illnesses occurred before the pandemic and will of course continue to happen many people would be expected to develop such health issues whether or not they get vaccinated if thorough investigation shows certain health problems are occurring at a higher than normal rate the vaccine could be to blame if not its more likely to be an unfortunate coincidence thats not related to the vaccinefor example rare cases of bells palsy and other neurologic disease have been reported after covid vaccination but so far there is no clear suggestion that the vaccine played any role similarly a fatal blood disorder suffered by a florida physician two weeks after receiving a covid19 vaccine raised concerns that it was triggered by the vaccine authorities are investigating this and similar cases this condition did not occur among the tens of thousands of clinical trial subjects so it might be a complete coincidence concerns that the vaccine can cause covid19 that cant happen because no live sarscov2 virus is used in currently available vaccines or those in development if a person develops covid19 soon after vaccination its not due to the vaccine its either because the vaccine failed (which is rather rare) or infection developed before the vaccine had a chance to work in fact some people may already be infected with the virus at the time of vaccination the bottom line so far we know covid19 is an unpredictable and potentially deadly disease and the information we have about the effectiveness and safety of covid19 vaccinations is encouraging minor side effects should be expected severe allergic reactions may rarely occur side effects from the vaccine are not reasons for most people to avoid vaccination as the number of vaccine recipients and the number of different vaccines grow vigilance is warranted what we know today about side effects and safety wont be the last word volunteers in clinical trials and members of the public who have received vaccinations continue to be monitored and are encouraged to report problems there are pros and cons to any new medical treatment but remember there are also pros and cons to declining treatment based on my reading of currently available information the decision to be vaccinated against covid19 should be an easy one																
169	1	The science behind covid19 vaccines parent faqs the science behind the covid19 vaccine parent faqs since covid19 vaccines were recommended for everyone age 5 and up millions of children and teens have been safely vaccinated now to keep as many kids protected as possible a booster dose is recommended for more kids and teens everyone age 12 through 17 years should get a booster shot if it has been at least five months since they had their second covid shot boosters help broaden and strengthen protection against omicron and other virus variants that cause covid19 disease whether youre the parent of a teen or a gradeschool age child you likely have questions about the vaccine and booster and topofmind for many parents is how we know that it is safe for kids here are answers to some common questions about the science behind the covid19 vaccine how does the covid19 vaccine work the covid19 vaccine works similarly to other vaccines your child has had germs such as sarscov2 the virus that causes covid19 invade and multiply inside the body the vaccine helps stop this by teaching the immune system to recognize and make antibodies that fight the virus children and teens who are vaccinated and boosted are better protected if they do get infected they likely will not be as sick as they would without the vaccine or booster they also are much less likely to be hospitalized if they get the virus how are mrna and viral vector covid19 vaccines different there are two types of vaccines currently available in the united states messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) vaccines (pfizer & moderna) and a viral vector vaccine (johnson & johnson) they all have the same result  protecting people from covid19 their delivery systems are just a bit different right now children and adolescents 5 to under 18 in the us can only receive the covid19 mrna vaccine from pfizer biontech covid19 mrna vaccines contain messenger rna (mrna) which is made up of nucleic acids nucleic acids found naturally in all our cells instructs them to make protein the mrna from the vaccine carries instructions delivered inside a lipid (fat) coating tells cells to produce harmless pieces of spike protein these look like spikes on the actual covid virus when the cells make these pieces of spike protein the immune system recognizes that they should not be there your childs body then makes antibodies that get rid of the spike pieces these antibodies remember how to protect your child from the virus in the future did you know even though widespread use of mrna vaccines is new this technology has been studied for decades mrna vaccines do not contain any live or dead parts of the virus viral vector vaccines also give instructions to your immune cells the instructions are carried in a harmless virus that has been changed so it is not able to copy itself spread and make your child sick the process is similar to the way the mrna vaccine works cells create the protein that is found on the virus that causes covid19 the persons immune system makes antibodies to get rid of the virus and that can remember how to protect them from getting very sick from the virus in the future do mrna vaccines change your dna no the covid19 vaccines made with messenger rna do not interact with your dna at all dna is your genetic material and it is stored in the nucleus of a cell the mrna in the vaccines never gets into the nucleus and once your immune cells have used the instructions they break down the mrna and it quickly exits the body what about boosters the mrna vaccines are given in a twodose series a single booster dose of the pfizer vaccine is authorized for kids 12 through 17 years old at least 5 months after the second dose of vaccine the viral vector vaccine in the united states is given in one dose to people 18 years and older an mrna vaccine booster dose or johnson & johnson booster is recommended at least two months after the first dose can children with immune conditions get a third dose yes a third dose is recommended for children and teens (age 5 and up) who have medical conditions or take medicines that weaken the immune system the third dose is given at least 28 days after the second dose of the vaccine how do we know covid19 vaccines are safe for kids over half of all kids 12 to 17 years old in the us have been fully vaccinated thats over 13 million kids who have had both of their doses of covid19 vaccine almost onefourth of all kids 5 through 11 have had at least one dose the vaccines continue to be monitored very closely in fact the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) say that covid19 vaccines will have the most intensive safety monitoring in us history																
170	1	Onedose j&j covid19 vaccine meets criteria as safe and effective fda report finds karen weintraub | usa today show caption detailed information on a johnson & johnson candidate vaccine for covid19 raises no safety concerns according to a report released early wednesday a food and drug administration advisory committee will hold an allday meeting friday to review the data and is likely to give the vaccine a thumbsup leading to an expected fda authorization for the vaccine in adults within the next few days the j&j vaccine differs from the two already authorized because only one shot is recommended instead of two the company also is studying a twodose regimen which might prove more effective or more durable in which case people might be encouraged to get a booster shot the vaccines and related biological products advisory committee or vrbpac is likely to sign off on the vaccine because it seems to have met all the criteria for authorization the fda established last year like the moderna and pfizerbiontech vaccines the one from j&j underwent a large clinical trial showing its safety and effectiveness and the company proved it can manufacture the vaccine in a safe and consistent manner us sticks with twodose covid19 vaccine schedule though study suggests one shot provides good shortterm protection once the committee gives its ok to the vaccine it will be up to the acting fda commissioner to authorize it which could happen within a few days the vaccine already is used in south africa and the company applied to the european union and the world health organization for authorization j&j agreed to provide 100 million doses of its vaccine in the usa by june including 20 million by the end of march those doses will add to the 300 million doses pfizerbiontech and moderna each have promised to deliver to the us government by the end of july dr victor peralta left examines sundar surujmohans vaccination card before giving him his second dose of covid19 vaccine in new york city on feb 5 dr victor peralta left examines sundar surujmohans vaccination card before giving him his second dose of covid19 vaccine in new york city on feb 5 seth wenig ap the vaccine was shown to be 72% effective in a trial in the usa in which all ethnic racial and age groups benefited about the same trials of the vaccine in other countries have shown less effectiveness  66% in latin america and 57% in south africa 28 days after the shots  probably because of variants of the virus circulating in those countries the same variants are circulating in the usa but not in very high numbers so the vaccine is likely to be useful here particularly because it requires only one dose fda prepares for variants covid19 vaccines tests work well but variants have fda preparing for a future when they may not how a new type of vaccine called mrna is changing the game to prevent covid19 the covid19 vaccine is using new technology that has never been used before in traditional vaccines heres how an mrna vaccine works just the faqs usa today although the j&j vaccine appears less effective than ones from pfizerbiontech and moderna its hard to make direct comparisons experts said because those trials were conducted months earlier at a different point in the pandemic when there were fewer known variants the j&j vaccine was shown to be 85% effective in preventing the most severe disease across all regions studied 28 days after the shot and proved more effective over time no cases of severe disease were reported after day 49 among those who were vaccinated the company defined severe disease as respiratory failure shock organ failure or the need for treatment in a hospital intensive care unit the vaccine can be stored in a refrigerator for three months and in a freezer for up to two years making it relatively easy to distribute through typical medical supply systems the fda is awarding covid19 vaccines emergency use authorization rather than full approval vaccine tracker tracking covid19 vaccine distribution by state how many people have been vaccinated in the usa although all the testing has been comparable to tests required for full approval the vaccines have not been required to show longerterm data which would delay their distribution during the pandemic all the companies are likely to eventually apply for full approval two more companies are likely to request authorization for their vaccines in the next few months astrazeneca working with oxford university developed a vaccine that finished enrolling volunteers in its largescale trial in january and novavax announced last week that it had completed enrollment both companies must wait to apply for authorization until at least half their participants are eight weeks out from their second shot and until enough participants in both placebo and active vaccine groups have come down with symptomatic covid19 to determine their vaccines effectiveness the astrazenecaoxford vaccine already has been authorized for use by the world health organization south africa has delayed using the vaccine until it can be tested further because an earlier trial suggested it was not very effective against the dominant variant in that country j&j vaccine trial details the j&j trial in which half the participants received an active vaccine and half a placebo did not include children or pregnant women in terms of demographics 38% of participants were older than 60 and 55% were male of the nearly 20000 participants in the usa 74% were white 15% hispanic 13% black 6% asian and 1% native american more than 40% of the trial participants globally had medical conditions putting them at higher risk for severe covid19 including obesity type 2 diabetes hypertension or hiv people with these medical conditions were not any more likely to develop covid19 than people without symptoms suggesting that the vaccine provides protection regardless of underlying illnesses nearly 10% tested positive for covid19 at the start of the study among the 682 trial participants who fell ill with covid19 at least two weeks after their shot 75% had received a placebo people over 60 seemed no more likely to fall ill than younger people participants who were black were only slightly more likely to fall ill than others representing 21% of the vaccinated group and almost 20% of the placebo group american indian participants including those in latin america were slightly more overrepresented accounting for 12% of those who were vaccinated but only 8% of those in the placebo group overall the vaccine appeared to be more effective over time the gap between the placebo and vaccinated groups widening from two weeks to three months after vaccination it seemed to be highly effective against severe disease particularly beginning about 28 days after vaccination in safety information released wednesday on more than 6700 trial participants nearly 49% had pain at their injection site 39% developed a headache after the shot 38% were tired and 33% had muscle pain nearly all these symptoms were considered mild or moderate and resolved in one or two days vaccine recipients over 60 were less likely than younger ones to suffer side effects which is consistent with the other vaccines nearly 20% of people in the active vaccine group took pain or fever medication in the week after their shot compared with 6% of those in the placebo group mostly driven by vaccine recipients under 60 people who received the active vaccine compared with placebo were slightly more likely to suffer from hives (five in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group) blood clots (15 versus 10) and ringing in their ears (six versus none) although it was unclear whether these symptoms were caused by the vaccine or simply coincidental in that subgroup there were no more serious events that could be linked to the vaccine the study found a total of 25 deaths were reported in the study five in the vaccinated group and 20 who received a placebo one serious allergic reaction was reported by a participant in the vaccinated group probably related to the shot but it was not classified as anaphylaxis cases of bells palsy a type of facial paralysis had been possibly associated with other covid19 vaccines in the j&j vaccine trail of four participants who came down with bells palsy half were in the vaccine group and half in the placebo group so there was no indication the vaccine caused the condition seven participants became pregnant after being vaccinated four in the placebo group and three in the active vaccine group two pregnancies in the placebo group were intentionally ended three ended in miscarriage or other problems (two in the active vaccine group one in the placebo group) and two are ongoing a study in rabbits found no suggestion that the vaccine might be toxic to the mother or offspring in pregnancy the company plans several followup studies including one in pregnant women one in adolescents in europe looking at health records and insurance claims of vaccinated people for safety and another focused on effectiveness vaccine providers must report any serious side effects from the vaccine to a national registry																
171	1	Covid vaccine testing and approval woman working with vaccine in lab many people are astonished by the unprecedented speed of covid vaccine testing the vaccine development process  for covid and any vaccine involves many layers of study testing and review according to the college of physicians of philadelphia vaccines usually take an average of 1015 years to create and yet the covid vaccines were developed in less than a year the vaccines for the novel coronavirus went through the same layers of review and testing as other vaccines due to the dire nature of the pandemic certain barriers to development related to funding and manufacturing were removed to understand how this is possible it is important to know how the vaccine development process typically works and how the covid vaccine was created still deciding about the vaccine or know someone who is see these 7 reasons to get the vaccine the traditional vaccine testing process testing vaccines is a complex process there are many layers of study and review that need to take place before a vaccine can be administered to a member of the general public discovery phase before any vaccine testing or development begins scientists study the structure of the virus and how it causes disease in the body this allows them to identify potential ways of creating an effective vaccine this process usually takes several years in contrast new technology allowed the genetic makeup of novel coronavirus to be shared with researchers worldwide just a few weeks after the first case of covid19 once scientists select the type of vaccine that looks the most promising the vaccine is then created in the lab preclinical testing in a laboratory setting scientists study the vaccine looking at the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in animals before moving to testing in humans clinical trials if enough research supports a vaccine candidate it can then be tested using clinical trials involving people these clinical trials which have three phases are tightly regulated by the food and drug administration (fda) in the case of the covid19 vaccine all three phases were planned simultaneously to prevent delays if a vaccine candidate was proven effective usually each phase is planned after the previous one is completed since companies dont want to put time and money behind a vaccine if it wont be successful this may result in 1to2year gaps between clinical trial phases the three phases are phase 1 clinical trial a study of usually less than 100 people is designed to determine if the vaccine is safe the best dosage and if there are any serious side effects phase 2 clinical trial a larger study with a few hundred volunteers focuses on how well the vaccine works these studies also continue to investigate its safety and side effects phase 3 clinical trial an even larger study often including thousands of volunteers allows scientists to compare people who receive the vaccine to those who did not they can better determine if the vaccine is safe and effective in a larger population of individuals volunteers are randomly selected to receive either the vaccine or an alternative control medication the control medication is usually a placebo or another vaccine that is already fdaapproved fda review of clinical trials the fda looks for evidence that the vaccine is unsafe ineffective or has side effects that outweigh the benefits of receiving the vaccine if there is substantial evidence that the vaccine is effective and it does no harm then the fda approves the vaccine for general public use if a vaccine is not proven safe has significant side effects or does not show efficacy the vaccine is not distributed to the public manufacturing traditionally vaccines manufacturing begins when phase 3 of clinical trials are being planned in the case of the covid19 vaccine manufacturing began in parallel with the clinical trials to ensure that fdaapproved vaccine candidates could be distributed quickly throughout the manufacturing process batches of vaccine are tested to ensure that theyre packaged and distributed in a way that maintains their effectiveness the fda routinely reviews the results of these tests additionally all manufacturing facilities are routinely inspected and expected to meet strict quality and safety standards continued safety monitoring after a vaccine is approved both the centers for disease control and prevention and the fda continue monitoring the safety of the vaccine while extremely rare if it happens experts quickly determine if the vaccine recommendations need to be reevaluated according to the world health organization adverse effects from vaccines are so rare that often their risk cannot be accurately assessed statistically how covid vaccine testing moved so fast the speed of covid vaccine development has given some people pause but this vaccine was created under unique circumstances here are some of the factors that sped up the covid vaccine testing process vaccine research funding vaccines can be expensive to create each step of the testing process requires significant financial investment from companies to minimize the chance of losing money companies usually want to see overwhelming evidence that the vaccine will ultimately be effective and worthy of fda approval before moving into the next step of testing this can lead to gaps in funding as well as an overall hesitancy to fund vaccine development efforts in the case of the covid19 vaccine public and private entities united to pour money into development efforts billions of dollars from the government and nonprofits allowed development to take place unimpeded by cost constraints preapproval vaccine manufacturing to cut costs companies usually wait until a vaccine is fdaapproved before manufacturing and distribution can begin in the case of the covid19 vaccine companies received funding from the government and federal agencies to cover manufacturing costs upfront millions of potential vaccine doses were created before they were actually approved this ensured that fdaapproved vaccine candidates would be distributed significantly faster vaccine candidates that are not proven safe and effective during clinical trials and arent approved by the fda will not be distributed administrative changes developing a vaccine is a top priority for the government fda and other regulatory bodies to speed along the review of vaccine efficacy data a number of administrative changes were made that prioritized covid vaccine work for example all covid19 vaccine clinical trial phases were planned at once to prevent the delay that can usually occur none of these changes have affected the way scientists or the fda evaluate vaccine safety when a safety concern arises at any stage of the process scientists halt the study to investigate further before continuing the study a few times during the development process of developing a covid vaccine clinical trials were paused so questions could be safely addressed a familiar virus while sarscov2 also known as the novel coronavirus was new to the world the family of viruses it came from was familiar to infectious disease scientists scientists were already researching potential vaccines for other coronaviruses such as sars and mers so they could apply much of what they had already learned to develop a covid vaccine additionally sarscov2 causes an acute illness this makes it inherently easier to vaccinate against vaccines against viruses that cause chronic illnesses such as hiv are usually more difficult to develop global communication and collaboration more advanced ways of communicating and sharing information globally have also significantly sped up the vaccine creation process nations across the globe have united to develop an effective covid19 vaccine as quickly and safely as possible for example the discovery phase of vaccine development is usually a very long process however the genetic makeup of novel coronavirus was shared with researchers worldwide just a few weeks after the first case of covid19 this allowed researchers and health organizations around the world to begin researching the best type of vaccine quickly new vaccine development technologies there are many different ways to develop a vaccine but in the last decade scientists have made significant advancements in this area for example older vaccines were typically created by using weakened or inactivated viruses today companies can simply read a viruss genetic code and synthesize it in a lab significantly shortening development times other recent advances in immunology genetics and other fields have enhanced scientists understanding of how to create an effective vaccine quickly																
172	1	Are covid19 vaccine ingredients safe covid19 vaccines give us our best shot at beating the pandemic in time everyone will have a chance to get one until then if you have concerns about whats in the vaccines these facts may give you peace of mind there is no live virus in the vaccines vaccines contain ingredients that help your body build immunity against a specific virus however not all vaccines have the same ingredients the two covid19 vaccines currently authorized for use in the us are the pfizerbiontech and moderna vaccines they are a newer type of vaccine called mrna vaccines they dont use live or weakened viruses to build immunity instead they use messenger rna (mrna) the mrna instructs cells to make a harmless piece of the viruss genetic material called the spike protein which is found on the surface of the novel coronavirus this teaches our immune systems to recognize and create antibodies to fight the real virus if we ever come into contact with it but because the vaccine doesnt contain any live virus theres no way it can give you covid19 the vaccines mrna does not stay in the body and it cannot change your dna also not included the pfizer and moderna vaccines also lack some other ingredients some people may be concerned about they do not have preservatives such as thimerosal (which contains an organic form of mercury) most vaccines do not use thimerosal or mercury and the type of mercury found in the few vaccines that do have thimerosal is not likely to build up in the body in tiny amounts it is safe in vaccines formaldehyde used to help make some vaccines eggs latex or antibiotics some people are allergic to these things microchips scientists are not putting microchips in any vaccines to track us thats a myth in fact its not even possible to do so what is in the shot like all vaccine ingredients those in the covid19 vaccines serve a specific purpose for instance some ingredients help the vaccine work others are needed to help produce the vaccine here are some of the other ingredients in the two covid19 vaccines now in use ask your doctor if you have any concerns about them pfizerbiontech vaccine ingredients ((4hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane61diyl)bis(2hexyldecanoate) 2[(polyethylene glycol)2000]nnditetradecylacetamide 12distearoylsnglycero3phosphocholine cholesterol potassium chloride monobasic potassium phosphate salt dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate sugar moderna vaccine ingredients sm102 polyethylene glycol (peg) 2000 dimyristoyl glycerol (dmg) cholesterol 12distearoylsnglycero3phosphocholine tromethamine tromethamine hydrochloride acetic acid sodium acetate sugar talk to your doctor some side effects have occurred with the covid19 vaccines most are minor such as a sore arm where people have received the shot a few people have had more serious allergic reactions but this is very rare the cdc says that if you have had an allergic reaction to peg or polysorbate you should not get an mrna covid19 vaccine you can help make your shot even safer by telling your provider if you have any allergies or other health problems have ever had an allergic reaction to a vaccine																
173	1	Photos covid19 vaccines begin to roll out across arizona coronavirus vaccines are being distributed at vaccination sites across arizona myths and rumors about covid19 vaccines are spreading fast likely in part because they are a new type of vaccine and were developed quickly the pfizerbiontech moderna and johnson & johnson covid19 vaccines in use in arizona have been thoroughly studied reviewed and approved for emergency use by the us food and drug administration the centers for disease control and prevention and the fda recommended a pause on use of the johnson & johnson singledose vaccine for 10 days in april as did the arizona department of health services over safety concerns about rare blood clots the vaccine is now back in use the fda expects manufacturers that receive an emergency use authorization to continue clinical trials in order to get more safety and efficacy data and eventually pursue final approval among the highprofile people who have received these vaccines are president joe biden vice president kamala harris former president donald trump former vice president mike pence arizona gov doug ducey and arizona department of health services director dr cara christ as of april 26 more than 28 million people in arizona had received at least one dose for more stories that matter subscribe to azcentralcom studies show that covid19 vaccines are effective at keeping people from developing covid19 or from getting seriously ill from the new coronavirus even if they do develop the respiratory illness the cdc says but if participants in recent teletown halls with ducey and christ are any indication questions suspicions rumors and concerns about vaccines are rampant misinformation about vaccine safety is a roadblock to vaccine uptake needed to beat the virus experts say arizona will need about 70% or more of the population vaccinated against covid19 in order to stop future outbreaks here are some common questions about covid19 vaccines answered with evidencebased information from sources that include the cdc the fda and the arizona department of health services what do i need to know about safety concerns with the johnson & johnson vaccine a pause on the johnson & johnson vaccine was first recommended on april 13 by the cdc and fda after reports at that time that six women developed rare and severe blood clots within two weeks of getting the johnson & johnson vaccine at that time one woman had died several states including arizona soon followed with similar recommendations to pause use of the vaccine the federal agencies and the state of arizona recommended the pause be lifted on april 23 after a review by the cdcs advisory committee on immunization practices by april 23 15 cases of a rare and severe blood clot called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts) had been reported in people who had received the johnson & johnson vaccine in the us the committee heard all were women and three died seven remain hospitalized including four who were in intensive care units more possible cases of tts after the johnson & johnson vaccine are being reviewed some of them in males the vaccine is available for all adults 18 and older and the fda cdc and practitioners will inform patients that the vaccine has been associated with rare and severe blood clots the fda has a fact sheet with information for patients the singledose vaccine which is also easier to store has been appealing to many will the covid19 vaccine give me coronavirus no the vaccines do not contain any of the covid19 virus and they cannot make you infected with the virus all three vaccines contain material that teaches the body how to guard against the virus if youre infected in the future i already had covid19 i have antibodies for the new coronavirus do i still need to get the vaccine health experts say yes its still unclear how long immunity lasts just from the bodys natural response to getting infected and its possible (although rare) that people can get infected with the virus a second time vaccines are recommended for longerlasting immunity and the cdc says the vaccine is a safer way to protect against the virus than getting covid19 we do recommend that you get vaccinated even if you previously had covid19 christ told a caller during a recent teletown hall we dont know how long those antibodies are going to stay around from a natural infection we do know that the vaccine produces a really strong immune response and really good antibodies and we know that it is currently effective against the variants that were seeing around the world as well so we would strongly encourage you to get the vaccine even if youve had covid19 before the only caveat here is if you were treated for covid19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma in which case its recommended you wait 90 days from that treatment to get a vaccine so that the vaccine can have the greatest effect if you got those treatments you should still get the vaccine the state health department says is the vaccine safe if i have underlying health conditions yes health experts and the cdc say the vaccines are safe unless you are allergic to a specific vaccine ingredient or have had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis or a reaction requiring hospitalization) to a vaccine ingredient in the past the cdc and adhs recommend getting a vaccine if you have certain underlying medical conditions because those conditions may put you at higher risk for severe covid19 illness hospitalization or death do the vaccines impact reproduction or fertility in any way there is no evidence of that unfounded claims linking covid19 vaccines to infertility have been scientifically disproven says a march 4 practice advisory from the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog recommends vaccination for all eligible people who may consider future pregnancy the vaccines impacting reproductive health and fertility is a myth christ said during a recent call answering questions from the community its not true that it will impact your fertility or your reproductive status there was an article online that was going through about the structure of that protein resembled a structure of part of the reproductive proteins but it is not long enough it was determined not to be big enough to actually have it recognized so there is no impact on fertility or your reproductive status if you get the vaccine she said the fda also says there is no scientific evidence to suggest that these vaccines could cause infertility in women us officials say infertility is not known to happen as a result of natural covid19 disease which shows that immune responses to the virus whether induced by infection or a vaccine are not a cause of infertility can i get the covid19 vaccine if im pregnant adhs says people who are pregnant or breastfeeding may decide to take a vaccine and it may be helpful to talk to their health care provider in making the decision pregnant people can be at an increased risk for severe illness from covid19 compared to nonpregnant people the cdc says but there are limited data available about the safety of covid19 vaccines for pregnant people the cdc says even though they are unlikely to pose a specific risk clinical trials focused on this are underway the cdc has more information on this topic text

injection site fatigue chills fever nausea headache or body aches for pfizer and moderna those shortterm side effects often arise within 24 hours to 72 hours after the shot and most often after the second dose side effects should go away within a few days of the shot there were no major safety concerns from the vaccines during clinical trials will the covid19 vaccine cause any coronavirus symptoms coughing shortness of breath and loss of smell and taste are not side effects of the vaccines if you have those after getting the shot you should be evaluated for possibly having covid19 separate from the vaccine adhs says the cdc has a webpage with more information on possible side effects why do the covid19 vaccines have side effects side effects are a good thing  they mean your body is building protection against covid19 through an immune response your body is not actively fighting the virus but is building the tools to do so if you get infected in the future side effects are a sign your body is responding ive heard the covid19 vaccine side effects are so bad that i might end up in the hospital is that true its unlikely that the covid19 vaccine will cause hospitalization severe reactions to the vaccines are rare and are reported to a national system called the vaccine adverse event reporting system so that the cdc can monitor the vaccines safety and follow up with any studies if needed during the first month of vaccine rollout in the us 138 million vaccine doses were administered and the vaccine adverse event reporting system received and processed nearly 7000 reports of adverse events after vaccination of those reports 91% were classified as nonserious and 9% (640) were classified as serious a recent cdc report says the most frequent side effects according to the feb 26 cdc report were headache fatigue and dizziness reports of anaphylaxis a severe allergic reaction were rare the report says and reactions were more commonly reported after the second pfizer vaccine dose than the first data from the second dose of moderna were not available because of the timing of the study and the time required in between moderna doses as of march 30 the cdc was reporting that anaphylaxis after covid19 vaccination is rare and has occurred in approximately two to five people per million vaccinated in the us based on events reported to vaers this kind of allergic reaction almost always occurs within 30 minutes after vaccination federal officials said fortunately vaccination providers have medicines available to effectively and immediately treat patients who experience anaphylaxis following vaccination the cdc has developed a vsafe after vaccination health checker smartphonebased surveillance tool for people who have received a covid19 vaccine to report any side effects directly to the federal agency side effects should resolve within a couple of days the cdc says people should call their doctor if their shoulder redness or tenderness worsens after 24 hours or if their side effects are concerning or not resolving after a few days how common are adverse reactions side effects are common but serious adverse reactions are not the cdc report on vaccines led by the cdcs covid19 response team and researchers from the fda said 113 deaths were reported to the federal adverse events reporting system for the covid19 vaccine most of them among longterm care facility residents the death numbers were consistent with allcause mortality rates cdc researchers found and did not indicate any unexpected pattern that might suggest a causal relationship with vaccination the safety monitoring program for the covid19 vaccine is the most comprehensive in us government history cdc officials say cases of anaphylaxis after receipt of both authorized vaccines have been observed though rarely anaphylaxis rates are comparable with those reported after receipt of other vaccines the feb 26 cdc report says no unexpected patterns of reactions or other safety concerns have been identified during early monitoring cdc and fda will continue to monitor the safety of covid19 vaccines to inform vaccination policy and to maintain public confidence the report says if i have covid19 can i still get vaccinated if you have covid19 and are eligible for a vaccine the recommendation is to wait until you no longer have symptoms and are finished with your isolation period before getting vaccinated but christ said theres no need to get a covid19 test to make sure you dont have the virus without symptoms prior to getting the vaccine can we stop wearing masks after getting the covid19 vaccine individuals are considered fully protected against covid19 about two weeks after their final vaccine dose that means two weeks after the second dose of pfizer or moderna or two weeks after the first and only dose of the johnson & johnson vaccine the cdc says if its been less than two weeks since the shot you should not consider yourself fully protected against the virus and you should keep up things such as wearing masks distancing avoiding crowds and washing hands even when fully vaccinated people should still take precautions such as wearing masks and socially distancing in public places until more data is collected on how vaccines impact the spread of the virus per the cdc will i have to get the covid19 vaccine every year thats not yet known researchers are still studying how long protection from the vaccines lasts which will determine how often we need booster shots what are the different vaccine types as of march 15 there were three approved vaccines in use in arizona that are two different types  mrna vaccines (pfizer and moderna) and viral vector vaccines (johnson & johnson) other vaccines are still in clinical trials the mrna or messenger rna vaccines are a new vaccine type that teaches cells to make proteins that spark an immune response the immune response produces antibodies that protect the body from getting infected from covid19 mrna vaccines do not contain the live virus and do not interact with dna viral vector vaccines such as j&j use an adjusted version of a different virus called the vector to send messages to cells the vector is not covid19 but rather is a different benign virus and causes cells to produce a protein that matches that of covid19 causing an immune response that produces antibodies the body has learned how to protect against covid19 in the future like mrna vaccines this kind of vaccine does not cause covid19 infection and does not interact with dna dig deeper coronavirus in arizona covid19 cases are on the rise again here are 3 reasons why long covid symptoms often overlooked in seniors fda authorizes pfizer covid vaccine booster for children 5 to 11 1m have died of covid in us heres one life we lost in each state can i trust the covid19 vaccine the available vaccines have been through rigorous clinical trials and approval processes but theres a lot of information circulating about the vaccines whether on social media in conversations with friends or on clubhouse an invitationonly audio app where conversations about the covid19 vaccine are taking place some of its accurate some is not asked during a teletown hall call whether the vaccine could be trusted given past public health wrongs like the tuskegee experiment christ said yes we know that there is mistrust due to historical reasons  that is why we have been working with faith leaders and community leaders to show that this vaccine is safe and effective and in the clinical trials it was very effective at stopping hospitalization and death and so we definitely want to make sure that youre protected and youre covered theres an adage that fears can be flattened with facts but in some cases patients with lingering questions and doubts may do better to speak with someone they trust such as a primary care doctor said dr natasha bhuyan a family physician in phoenix and a faculty member at the university of arizona college of medicine phoenix patients have been inundated with mixed messaging about covid about covid transmission about emerging therapies and obviously the efficacy of masks and now the same goes for vaccines bhuyan said during a march 10 web briefing a conversation with a trusted clinician is a powerful tool																
174	1	The long view on covid19 vaccine safety and efficacy penn researchers weigh in on the regulatory and scientific efforts to track covid19 vaccines covid vaccine bottle between december 2020 and february 2021 three drugmakers received emergency use authorizations to distribute covid19 vaccines the next step is a biologics license applicationthe technical name for full approvala process pfizer and moderna have already begun experts from penn are keeping a close eye on these regulatory steps as well as the reporting mechanisms involved in assessing vaccine safety the outlook thus far seems promising (image daniel schlud) the mrna vaccines for covid19 made by pfizer/biontech and moderna are among the most powerful vaccines the world has ever seen according to clinical trial data they are more than 94% effective at preventing symptomatic disease with realworld data bearing out that success the other vaccine currently available in the us johnson & johnsons janssen vaccine uses a viral vector and is also proving its strength its efficacy which is better than seasonal flu shots is 70% generally and even stronger against hospitalizations and death while these are new vaccines the mrna technologythe brainchild of the perelman school of medicines drew weissman and katalin karikohas been tested in animals for years with excellent results and the pfizer/biontech and moderna products have been used in broad circulation for half a year with companies actively pursuing fda approval experts from penn are keeping a close eye on the regulatory steps and reporting mechanisms involved in assessing vaccine safety others are conducting their own studies to evaluate the immune responses the vaccines inspire the outlook thus far seems promising and rigorous research will continue to provide evidence that can safeguard public health and ensure trust in vaccines in the months and years to come after the emergency use authorization part of the safety watch on these new biologics will happen through the regulatory process which began with clinical trials for covid19 vaccines these trials happened much faster than is typical but that doesnt mean any corners were cut says susan ellenberg a biostatistician at the perelman school of medicine in collaboration with community groups penn medicine has administered thousands of covid19 vaccines through community clinics in west and southwest philadelphia (image dan burke) drug companies could enroll participants and collect the data they needed so quickly because the virus was everywhere this isnt just a childhood disease or something rare she says it was a global problem with a huge amount of transmission and a huge number of people getting sick in addition the number of trial participants for these vaccines exceeded whats typical for vaccine trials beyond that to support emergency use authorization (eua) for these vaccines the fda asked for a median of two months of followup safety data after participants completed the full vaccination regimen a figure based on the fact that adverse events tend to appear in the first two months after vaccine administration ordinarily the fda would require safety data from a longer followup period but an eua is not the same as full fda approval the two have a lot in common but the emergency use authorization standard is differentand lower says penn medicine bioethicist holly fernandez lynch you only have to demonstrate that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks and that the product may be effective however because vaccines are given to healthy people rather than those already sick with covid19 the fda applied an eua plus standard demanding more safety and efficacy data than it required for euas granted to covid19 therapeutics needing just two months of safety data put the vaccines in front of the fda sooner which allowed for quick authorization aimed at addressing the public health emergency the first covid19 vaccine euas were granted in december 2020 the most recent for the janssen vaccine came in february 2021 but safety followup didnt stop there researchers continued to watch trial participants and track side effects reported by those in the community who had been vaccinated whats clear is that these vaccines are amazing in terms of the immunological response they induce theyre among the best vaccines weve studied penn medicine immunologist john wherry twitter facebook the next step is applying for a biologics license application (bla) the technical name for full approval for such drugs some americans have said they want to wait for full approval before getting vaccinated and some employers are waiting to mandate vaccines until full approval is granted while not there quite yet things are moving in that direction in may the fda issued guidance stating that any drugmakers that had not yet started discussions with the agency about pursuing an eua should instead move directly to a bla pfizer and moderna have each begun the bla process though its possible it could still take months to complete the big difference here is that the fda is going to be looking at that longerterm safety data and doing deeper checks into manufacturing processes for example not a lot is going to change says fernandez lynch the studies were really good the efficacy data was clearly there thats all going to stand longerterm safety with some looking for more assurance of vaccine safety blipspausing the janssen vaccine rollout when several rare blood clotting cases came to light for instancecan heighten concern at the same time identifying and thoroughly investigating safety concerns can also bolster public confidence that regulators are paying attention thats what happened in the case of the rare blood clots during the clinical trial last fall one person was reported to have developed the clots prompting janssen to hit pause and investigate it resumed after investigations failed to definitively link the clotting to the vaccine once the vaccine recipient pool grew from tens of thousands of people in the trial to millions in the general population however more cases of unusual clotting emerged from their careful study during the trial regulators were prepared to quickly investigate more often however rare adverse events arent seen at allnot even in one person as with the janssen vaccineuntil a vaccine has massive distribution that proved true with another rare side effect recently linked to the janssen vaccine a slightly increased risk of the neurological condition guillainbarre syndrome according to the new york times the fda is expected to add another warning to that particular drug after approximately 100 cases of guillainbarre were reported from 128 million shots even with the big trials something that happens to 1 in 100000 or 1 in 500000 youre probably not going to see that in these trials ellenberg says a transmission electron microscope reveals sarscov2 (in blue) from the first confirmed us case of the virus the mrna vaccines against sarscov2 appear to evoke a strong persistent response to the virus according to studies at penn and elsewhere (image cdc/hannah a bullock and azaibi tamin) though the clotting events and guillainbarre cases may well be linked to vaccination other conditions that some vaccine recipients attribute to their shots may not be grounded in fact when you vaccinate everyone all the bad things that happen to people will happen after they get a vaccine ellenberg says some of those events are going to happen in reasonably close time to the vaccine and those people are going to suspect that the vaccine caused it even if you can show mathematically that the number of people who had this event in this period of time after getting vaccinated is no more than expected the most challenging fear to quell relates to longterm effects of the vaccines years or even decades down the line based on what we know about mechanisms of vaccine action and the fact that for other vaccines such delayed side effects have not materialized theres little expectation of longterm effectseven for the newer mrna vaccines as these vaccines come up for regular fda approval and beyond its something all parties involved will continue to study alongside the crucial question of how long their protection lasts enduring immunity whats clear is that these vaccines are amazing says immunologist john wherry of penn medicine in terms of the immunological response they induce theyre among the best vaccines weve studied adverse events are quite rare and while side effects are very common they are likely telling us that the vaccine is working wherry and immunologist scott hensley are among scientists working to more definitively answer the protection duration question using data from a patient cohort immunized with either the pfizer/biontech or moderna vaccines at penn by evaluating antibody responses alongside additional components of the immune system the researchers are looking under the hood hensley says at how the body responds to the vaccines they hope to find out not only how long people may be protected but also about the quality and mechanics of that protection even with the big trials something that happens to 1 in 100000 or 1 in 500000 youre probably not going to see that in these trials penn medicine biostatistician susan ellenberg twitter facebook following vaccination the immune systems b cells produce antibodies against sarscov2 a response that for the new mrnabased drugs appears unusually strong compared to other types of vaccines it does seem theres something unique about mrna vaccines and their ability to induce longlasting responses hensley says antibody levels inevitably wane over time and theoretically so should the conferred protection yet the mrna vaccines appear to set the body up for extended protection by engaging memory b cells which can live for years if you get a later infection or receive a booster shot these are the cells youre calling back into action wherry says and while b cells can make antibodies that prevent infection b cells dont work alone t cells also help address infections by killing off other cells infected by the invading virus according to wherry immunological studies of vaccinated individuals have shown that the first vaccine dose does a really good job of priming t cells and an average job of priming b cells the second dose kicks the b cells quickly into action working in concert with t cells soon after vaccines were authorized in december 2020 health care workers including many at penn were among the first to get vaccinated researchers john wherry and scott hensley are tracking a cohort of vaccinated individuals to obtain a detailed picture of the immune systems response to the vaccine as well as how long immunity may last (image dan burke) the immune response after the second dose is much more coordinated he says almost a synergy of things that get you very rapidly to a high level of protection individuals who had recovered from a covid19 infection showed a similar response after just one dose according to a study wherry led in drew weissmans lab research in animal models has show protection can last more than a year half of a mouses life though he notes that those studies used higher doses than what people are receiving in the currently authorized vaccines my guess is that durability is partially dosedependent he says the companies conducting the phase 3 clinical trials which evaluate vaccine safety and efficacy will follow participants for two years but socalled phase 4 trials using realworld data from nontrial participants including research at penn will further augment our vaccine understanding broadening protection the big monkey wrench to vaccines says hensley are emerging variants its clear that vaccineinduced antibody responses are very high to the wuhan isolate of sarscov2 he says but its also clear that those antibodies react less well to the variants that are in circulation today related racing to deliver a vaccine to the masses understanding and addressing barriers to covid vaccine acceptance how can the world allocate covid19 vaccines fairly from animals to people and back again in the vaccine trenches with katalin kariko and drew weissman the pfizerbiontech vaccine emergency use authorization five takeaways hensley notes that responses are still good but as the pandemic continues to surge across the world the virus has more opportunities to mutate in ways that could dodge vaccinegenerated immunity thats one reason its so crucial to ensure access to vaccines around the globe fortunately wherry notes that viruses arent the only entities that change antibodies themselves acquire mutations to become more focused and effective at targeting pathogens its really fascinating he says a booster gives the immune system the opportunity to continue to push and reshape the antibody response which might give immunized individuals a leg up even when faced with new variants pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions are testing different boosters currently using both new sequences of the spike protein mrna and combinations of existing vaccines to augment immunity one strength of the mrna vaccine platform is its production speed boosters that target a different form of the virus could be brought to market quickly its plug and play weissman says he also notes that the fda may determine that phase 3 efficacy studies are not required for boosters similar to how the annual flu vaccines are regulated further smoothing the pathway looking forward in addition to the three currently available in the us many more vaccines are in one stage of development or another how might they ethically and effectively receive the gold standard placebocontrolled testing as more and more people get vaccinated as vaccination rates tick up trial participants without at least some level of protection against covid will be harder to come by having contributed seminal discoveries that advanced the mrna vaccines drew weissman and colleagues are now looking toward the next challenge theyve recently published studies describing a new vaccine that could protect against a variety of coronaviruses not just one (image dan burke) in january ellenberg and colleagues published a paper in the new england journal of medicine suggesting such trials could still occur in countries without sufficient access to currently authorized vaccines its terrible that many countries are not getting enough she says but if the vaccines are not there yet then i think its ethical to do a placebocontrolled trial in those places assuming she adds that once the vaccines prove safe and effective people who received the placebo are offered the shot instead theres another alternative too headtohead assessment of a new vaccine against one already proven to work but its really hard to compare a new vaccine with something that has 90% efficacy says fernandez lynch you have to enroll loads of people to see any infections each of these individual vaccines focuses purely on sarscov2 but there have been three total coronavirus epidemics in the past 20 years says weissman theres just no way were not going to have more what if one vaccine could protect against them all thats what weissman and colleagues have in mind with their pancoronavirus vaccine which they recently described in the journal nature our thinking was lets make a vaccine now that will prevent infection with future betacoronaviruses he says their experimental vaccine blocks sarscov2 including variants as well as the sars virus that caused the 2003 outbreak and other coronaviruses found in bats we think thats a great start weissman says a creative rendition of sarscov2 virus particles not to scale as of midjuly the virus has sickened more than 186 million people worldwide and more than 4 million people have died from it according to the world health organization globally more than 33 billion vaccine doses have been administered (homepage image niaid) susan ellenberg is emeritus professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the university of pennsylvania perelman school of medicine holly fernandez lynch is the

175	1	Covid19 vaccines 4th dose welltolerated and boosts immune response clinical trials so far have shown that a fourth dose of covid19 vaccines is safe and welltolerated camilo freedman/sopa images/lightrocket via getty images a recent randomized clinical trial has shown that receiving the fourth dose of either the pfizer or moderna mrna vaccines approximately seven months after the third dose could safely boost the immune response the study is ongoing and will also evaluate the immune response 84 days after the fourth dose to assess its effectiveness in the longer term the results could help inform public policy decisions about whether the whole population or specific vulnerable groups should receive a fourth dose evidence from the covboost trial an ongoing clinical trial in the united kingdom suggests that a fourth dose of the covid19 mrna vaccines can boost the immune response to a similar if not larger extent as the third dose (first booster) this study published in lancet infectious diseasetrusted source is the first randomized clinical trial to report on the effectiveness and safety of a fourth covid19 dose moreover in this study the vaccines used for the initial two doses and the two booster doses were different the 4th dose or 2nd booster covid19 vaccines train the bodys immune system to elicit a rapid response to sarscov2 they induce an immune response involving the activation of b cells which helps the body produce antibodies against the sarscov2 spike protein higher levels of antibodies against the spike protein are associatedtrusted source with a lower risk of contracting a sarscov2 infection covid19 vaccines also elicit the production of t cells which protecttrusted source against severe disease the emergence of the highly contagious omicron variant prompted public health authorities to authorize a third dose or booster shot of covid19 vaccines however studiestrusted source have shown that the protection conferred by a third shot starts to wane after a few months this has spurred some countries including israel germany the united kingdom and the united states to introduce a fourth covid19 vaccine dose for now reserved for older individuals or vulnerable individuals however there is limited data on the protective effects of a fourth dose observational studies conducted in israel suggest that a fourth dose of the pfizer vaccine could reduce the risk of a sarscov2 infection and prevent severe illness at least until four months after the initial booster or third dose besides their observational nature the studies in israel involved individuals receiving all four doses of the pfizer vaccine the present randomized clinical trialtrusted source investigated the effectiveness of a fourth dose in individuals who received different vaccines for their booster and initial two primary series vaccine doses boosters a full dose vs half dose the present study involved 166 participants ages 30 or older participating in the covboost trial these participants had received either two doses of the astrazeneca or the pfizer vaccines as their initial two doses all 166 participants received a third shot of the fulldose pfizer vaccine as a part of the trial at approximately 7 months after the third vaccine dose these participants were randomized to receive either the full dose pfizer vaccine or the half dose moderna vaccine as their second booster (the fourth dose) the researchers collected blood samples just before the fourth dose and 14 days after to assess changes in antibody and t cell responses due to the fourth dose using data previously collected 28 days after the third dose the researchers were able to compare the immune response after the third and fourth doses the researchers found a decline in the antibody and t cell responses during the 7month period between the third dose and immediately before the fourth covid19 vaccine dose the fourth doseeither the pfizer or moderna vaccinerestored the immune response 14 days after immunization specifically depending on the vaccine used for the initial two doses and the fourth dose there was an 11 to 20fold increase in antispike antibody levels and a 35 to 11fold increase in the tcell response over the 14day period after receiving the fourth dose reaching maximum immunity however a subset of individuals showed only a limited increase in immune response after the fourth dose these individuals had an elevated response even before the fourth dose this suggests that the immune response cannot be enhanced beyond a certain upper limit by additional boosters this ceiling effect indicates that a fourth dose may not be beneficial to all individuals further research into the underlying factors will be needed to inform public policy decisions about booster vaccines for vulnerable individuals the 3rd dose vs 4th dose the antibody response to the spike protein was 159fold higher at 14 days after the fourth dose of the pfizer vaccine than 28 days after the third dose similarly a fourth dose of the moderna vaccine resulted in a 229fold higher antibody response than after the third dose the magnitude of the tcell response was similar after the third and fourth vaccine doses however there was a more pronounced tcell response after the fourth dose in the group that received three initial doses of the pfizer vaccine and a fourth dose of the moderna vaccine the researchers did not observe an age difference in the immune response after the fourth dose the pfizer and moderna shots were also generally tolerated with pain at the injection site headache fatigue malaise and muscle ache being the most common adverse effects some limitations the studys authors acknowledged that the immune response after the third and fourth doses were measured at different times following the booster dose however they noted that previous studies have shown that the immune response remains stable between 7 and 28 days after immunization the number of participants included in the study was also small moreover the antibody response was measured against the wildtype sarscov2 spike protein and not the spike protein from variants of concern including the omicron variant dr duane wesemann an associate professor of medicine at harvard medical school told medical news today what is missing in this study is an evaluation of what reactivity to omicron variants looks like after a fourth shot because antibody levels generally correlate with both protective function and breadth its safe to assume that more is better [i]tll be important to understand how the fourth shot influences antibody quality and cross variant recognition part of the utility of boosting will depend on the rate of viral escape as well as the degree to which older variants remain in circulation he explained what about variantspecific vaccines dr mark sangster an immunologist at the university of rochester medical center said that the sole focus should not be on antibodies when one talks about protection against covid19 people seem to obsess about circulating antibody levels but pay little attention to the more broadlyreactive (and long lasting) memory b cells that are generated in parallel with antibodies and provide key backup protection when antibody levels wane he told mnt a number of recent studies have demonstrated that memory b cells generated by sarscov2 vaccines respond effectively to omicron infection vaccineinduced t cells could also contribute to the protection but their role is less clear he said waiting for a vaccine that delivers a current variant of the spike protein might be preferable to a fourth dose of the same protein  dr mark sangster however experts are divided about the feasibility and advantages of a variantspecific vaccine dr miles davenport an immunologist at the university of new south wales said that considering the rapid emergence of new variants and their spread it seems unlikely that variantspecific vaccines can ever be rolled out in a meaningful timeframe at the moment there is no clear evidence that variantspecific vaccines give major advantages compared to the original vaccine he told mnt i think a good model for where we may end up is the annual influenza vaccine where each year we try to make a best guess of which current strains will be most similar to the next years strain this choice of next variant is understood to be a little hitandmiss but nonetheless we get significant benefit from these annual vaccines he added																
176	1	Vaccine safety  covid19 vaccine elisabeth anderson jinpeng li norbert kaminski  january 25 2021 save tweet print email in this series were exploring vaccines the ingredients found in vaccines and vaccine safety in this post we look at the currently available covid19 vaccines in the us and the ingredients that make up these vaccines what are vaccines a vaccine is a biological preparation designed to provide our body with active immunity to particular infectious pathogens when appropriately administered vaccines stimulate immunological memory once weve received a vaccine our bodys immune system can recall a specific pathogens identity even years later and effectively fight the pathogen you can learn more about how vaccines work ingredients in vaccines and general comments about their safety in our previous blog posts (12) what type of vaccine is the covid19 vaccine due to the urgency to develop a vaccine against covid19 various approaches have been employed both established and novel by numerous pharmaceutical companies to date two vaccines have been approved by thehttp//gomsuedu/crisconnect us food and drug administration both of these approved covid19 vaccines have capitalized on a novel strategy to develop what is termed a messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) vaccine an mrna vaccine provides instructions to our cells to produce harmless proteins that trigger an immune response how do the covid19 mrna vaccines work like most viruses the virion of the sarscov2 virus that causes covid19 contains a ribonucleic acid (rna) center coated in an envelope of protein and fat once a virus enters a host (our body) the protein binds to the hosts healthy cells facilitating the entry of viral rna into host cells and forces the healthy cells to produce copies of the virus when this occurs we have an infection as weve discussed in a prior blog post once were infected our bodys white blood cells multiply to stop the virus but that takes time (1) while most healthy individuals successfully fight off covid19 infections many individuals with underlying health concerns cannot fight off the infection causing them to succumb to the disease we know our bodys immune system can destroy the virus if given enough time the covid19 mrna vaccine primes our body to respond more effectively by expanding those cells that can recognize and then destroy the sarscov2 virus unlike attenuated vaccines that use weakened pathogens to prime our immune system to fight infection the covid19 mrna vaccines do not contain any sarscov2 virus instead they contain mrna that gives our cells instructions to make a harmlesstous piece of protein thats the same as the protein present in the sarscov2 virus the protein then teaches our immune cells to identify and combat the sarscov2 virus once our body makes the harmlesstous protein our body breaks down the instructions (mrna) and eliminates the instructions from our body leaving our body with the protein next our bodys immune system will recognize the protein as foreign (ie doesnt belong to us) and develop an immune response including antibodies to destroy the protein as weve covered in a prior post our bodys immune system remembers how to fight and eliminate unwanted pathogens now that our bodys immune system knows how to destroy the protein found on the sarscov2 virus that causes covid19 infections if we are exposed to covid19 our body has been trained to identify and destroy the protein that keeps the sarscov2 virus viable and thus protect us from the virus (1) what ingredients are in the covid19 vaccine there are two vaccines available today one from pfizerbiontech and one from moderna both vaccines are mrna vaccines pfizerbiontech vaccine ingredients (1) active ingredient messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) lipids (fats) (4hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane61diyl)bis(2hexyldecanoate) 2[(polyethylene glycol)2000]nnditetradecylacetamide 12distearoylsnglycero3phosphocholine cholesterol stabilizers (buffer solution and salts) potassium chloride monobasic potassium phosphate sodium chloride dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate sugar sucrose moderna vaccine ingredients (1) active ingredient messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) lipids (fats) sm102 polyethylene glycol [peg] 2000 dimyristoyl glycerol [dmg] cholesterol 12distearoylsnglycero3phosphocholine [dspc] stabilizers (buffer solution and salts) tromethamine tromethamine hydrochloride acetic acid sodium acetate sugar sucrose what ingredients are not in the covid19 vaccine weve noticed some misleading information about the ingredients present in vaccines making the rounds on social media channels and blogs we believe its important to dispel some of these unfounded claims (1234) covid19 virus is not in the vaccine fetal cells are not in the vaccine human blood and tissue products are not in the vaccine egg products are not in the vaccine preservatives (eg mercury thimerosal) are not in the vaccine antibiotics are not in the vaccine latex products are not in the vaccine and were not used in production pork products are not in the vaccine microchips are not in the vaccine how effective is the vaccine when administered properly the pfizerbiontech vaccine is 95% effective in preventing covid19 infections in all individuals ages 16 and above (1) when administered properly the moderna vaccine is 95% effective in preventing covid19 infections in all individuals ages 18 and above (1) have the vaccines been tested and are they safe while these may be new vaccines released in an emergent circumstance the us food and drug administration (fda) still has strict quality safety and efficacy requirements that pfizerbiontech and moderna met (1) tens of thousands of individuals received the vaccines by participating in clinical studies to ensure the vaccines safety and efficacy (1) based on the current data both vaccines are safe and effective in preventing severe covid19 infections has anyone died from getting the vaccine at the time of publication there are no confirmed cases of an individual dying due to the covid19 vaccines there have been a handful of adverse reactions that have required immediate medical assistance so its important to talk with your doctor before getting vaccinated if you have a history of adverse reactions to vaccines sadly more than 410000 americans have died from complications related to covid19 infections who benefits most from the covid19 vaccines though society as a whole benefits from herd immunity which results from widespread vaccination there are subgroups that are more acutely impacted by covid19 infections adults 65 and older (1) individuals with medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic respiratory conditions obesity compromised immune systems and more (1) can anyone receive a vaccine at the time of publication the covid19 vaccine supply is still somewhat limited as production continues to gear up so government health agencies are prioritizing vaccine distribution based on an individuals risk factors occupation age and other specific criteria individuals whove had an allergic reaction to vaccines in the past or who have specific health conditions should speak with their doctor before receiving a vaccine how can i signup to get vaccinated at the time of publication vaccine distribution is routing through local health departments but may vary state to state to learn more about the covid19 vaccine distribution process in your area reach out to your local health department the good news we have safe effective

177	1	Covid19 vaccine safety for kidswhat you need to know according to an expert by dory zayas published on december 02 2021 fact checked by emily swaim share tweet email print girl getting vaccine bogdankosanovic / getty images key takeaways the pfizer covid19 vaccine has been approved for children aged 5 to 11 and millions have received their first dose safely children receive a smaller dose of the vaccine and are encouraged to get a second dose three weeks later just like adults the vaccine has been tested in trials and has been proven to be safe and effective chances are that if your child is between 5 and 11 years old you have been frenetically watching the news and waiting for the approval of the covid19 vaccine in children however now that the pfizer vaccine has been approved for emergency authorization many parents have a host of questions they want to be answered before bringing their child for their shot as of november 17 the white house says that 26 million children aged 5 to 11 have received the vaccine which is 10% of the total population of that age group living in the united states1 we spoke with an expertsara siddiqui md faap who specializes in pediatric and adolescent medicine at nyu langone huntington medical group in new yorkto help separate fact from fiction dr siddiqui a boardcertified physician treats children from birth to 21 years old and has been practicing for nearly 20 years dr siddiqui dispels myths about the vaccine explains the risks and describes the dosage kids will receive how did the fda determine the effectiveness and safety for children 511 years old to receive the covid19 vaccine dr siddiqui the fda uses rigorous standards to determine and ultimately approve vaccines for administration they use strict criteria to ensure safety and efficacy these standards have been maintained in the approval process for the covid19 vaccines the timeline was able to be improved as the meeting process was moved upnot the actual studies performed2 how long have these vaccines been in trials have there been any longterm effects in kids dr siddiqui pediatric covid19 vaccine trials began as early as june 2020 the pfizer trial included approximately 4600 children (3100 who got the vaccine 1500 who got placebo) and showed a 91% effectiveness against contracting covid193 in the pediatric trial for ages 511 years old side effects included arm pain and redness at the vaccination site and fever longterm effects for all vaccines currently approved usually occur in the first six to nine months of the administration the pediatric covid19 vaccine was done over a period of 18 months pfizers covid19 vaccine for kids ages 5 to 11 what to know what is the dosing size and do kids need two shots spaced out like adults dr siddiqui the current recommendation for the pfizer pediatric vaccine ages 5 to 11 years is a 10mcg [microgram] dosing requiring two doses taken three weeks apart full vaccination effect is considered two weeks after the second dose side effects such as arm pain and redness usually occur within the first 48 hours of administration [adult covid19 vaccines are 30 micrograms]3 what are the most common side effects for kids after getting the vaccine dr siddiqui the most common side effects for ages 5 to 11 years of age were arm pain redness and/or swelling at the injection site other side effects include tiredness headache muscle pain chills fever and nausea3 this is typical with many other vaccines as well what medications can/should i give my child after the shot to ease the pain dr siddiqui you may wish to administer acetaminophen or ibuprofen to a child experiencing side effects after vaccination placing a cool damp cloth at the site will help as well please discuss dosing and frequency of nonaspirin medications with your pediatrician or childcare provider how to talk to your kids about coronavirus (covid19) what is myocarditis how high is the risk dr siddiqui myocarditis is an accumulation of fluid and swelling around the heart muscle and can occur after some viral infections it is a rare side effect reported after covid19 vaccination in children ages 12 and up4 myocarditis and pericarditis can be a result of covid19 infection as well and is a rare occurrence in children side effects after vaccination resulting in myocarditis are much less severe than those reported after covid19 infection in children5 also myocarditis reported after vaccination was treated with ibuprofen and those children recovered quickly with less severe symptoms6 please contact your childs healthcare provider if your child experiences chest pain shortness of breath extreme fatigue or rapid heart rate after receiving the first or second covid19 vaccination5 in the pediatric covid19 vaccine trial for ages 5 to 11 there were no reported cases of myocarditis4 it is thought the decrease in dosing may have helped with the reduction in the side effects the pediatric covid19 vaccine approved for ages 5 to 11 is onethird of the dose of the 12+ pfizer covid19 vaccine why do vaccine requirements vary by age dr siddiqui during the initial trial phase dosing requirements varied with age as the immune system may function differently in children than adults trials for ages 6 months and up are also currently ongoing with even more of a reduction in dosing being given can my child get the covid 19 vaccine at the same time as their flu shot dr siddiqui the current recommendation by the cdc and advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) is that yes both can be given at the same time4 how will the covid19 vaccine affect my childs regular shot schedule when do you expect the vaccine to be available for children under 5 dr siddiqui current pediatric trials for covid19 vaccination in ages 6 months and above are underway hopefully we will be seeing the results of that data soon can my child get a breakthrough case of covid19 after vaccination like some adults have will it lessen the severity dr siddiqui covid19 vaccination greatly reduces the risk of severe disease and hospitalization there may be a chance of breakthrough cases even for those vaccinated however the risk of severe illness and mortality has been shown to be significantly reduced5 there have been rumors this vaccine will affect future fertility or menstrual cycles in our children does the covid19 vaccine impact fertility dr siddiqui unfortunately misinformation regarding fertility and the covid19 vaccine has spread the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists has put out multiple statements regarding the safety and efficacy of the covid vaccine in all women including during pregnancy and lactation7 the current mrna vaccine does not change the dna of the cells nor does it travel within the nucleus of the cell where the dna is present8 the mrna vaccine simply gives cells a map to produce the spike protein by cells then the cells produce antibodies against the spike protein the actual mrna is destroyed soon after and does not stay in the system the mrna vaccine does not impact fertility in males or females5 should kids still wear masks if they are vaccinated dr siddiqui until a significant number of the population has been vaccinated and covid19 case counts hospitalizations morbidity and mortality have been shown to be reduced we may need to continue mitigation strategies when in indoor crowded areas especially in the winter this would include getting vaccinated if eligible masking distancing and testing when sick hopefully soon we will be one step closer to returning to normal what this means for you if you have a child between the ages of 5 and 11 its important to get them vaccinated as soon as possible the vaccine has been proven to be safe and effective for this age group getting your child vaccinated will help stop the spread of the virus during the holiday season and winter months and beyond be sure to talk to your childs healthcare provider if you have additional questions																
178	1	What are vaccines a vaccine is a biological preparation designed to provide our body with active immunity to particular infectious pathogens when appropriately administered vaccines stimulate immune responses and build immunological memory once weve received a vaccine our bodys immune system can recall a specific pathogens identity even years later and effectively fight the pathogenyou can learn more about how vaccines work ingredients in vaccines and general comments about their safety in our previous blog posts (12) how does the newest vaccine work unlike the other two vaccines available the newest vaccine by janssen (j&j) does not use the latest mrna technology to build our systems immunity rather the j&j vaccines use a more traditional mechanism to trigger an immune response the j&j vaccine is a recombinant vaccine (12) it contains a safe adenovirus vector that has been engineered to make a harmless to us version of the spike protein found on the sarscov2 virus by doing so it serves as a dummy to train our immune system to better combat the sarscov2 virus (1) as we know once a virus enters a host (our body) the protein binds to the hosts healthy cells facilitating the entry of viral rna into host cells and forces the healthy cells to produce copies of the virus when this occurs we have an infection once were infected our bodys white blood cells multiply to stop the virus but that takes time (1) while most healthy individuals successfully fight off the sarscov2 virus infection many individuals with underlying health concerns cannot fight off the infection causing them to succumb to the disease we know our bodys immune system can destroy the virus if given enough time the j&j vaccine primes our body to respond more effectively by expanding those immune cells (white blood cells) that can recognize and then destroy the sarscov2 virus unlike the pfizerbiontech and moderna vaccines the j&j vaccine does not use mrna instead it uses an adenovirus vector to get the needed instructions to our cells the adenovirus vector is essentially a harmless cold virus that cannot replicate itself in our body nor can it cause disease therefore it has been used as a platform for a variety of vaccines its safety has been demonstrated by several clinical studies with more than 100000 participants (1) the adenovirus vector in the j&j vaccine has been engineered to make a harmlesstous piece of protein thats the same as the protein present in the sarscov2 virus the protein then teaches our immune cells to identify and combat the sarscov2 virus next our bodys immune system will recognize the protein as foreign (ie doesnt belong to us) and develop an immune response including antibodies that bind to the protein and eliminate the pathogen as weve covered in a prior post our bodys immune system remembers how to fight and eliminate unwanted pathogens now that our bodys immune system has been trained and remembers how to identify the protein found on the sarscov2 virus that causes covid19 if we are exposed to the sarscov2 virus our body will effectively produce antibodies that can binds to the protein on the sarscov2 virus and eliminate the virus thus protecting us from the virus (1) what ingredients are in the j&j covid19 vaccine janssen (j&j) covid19 vaccine (1) active ingredient recombinant replicationincompetent adenovirus type 26 expressing the sarscov2 spike protein inactive ingredients (including stabilizer buffer solution and salts) 2hydroxypropylcyclodextrin (hbcd) citric acid monohydrate ethanol polysorbate80 sodium chloride trisodium citrate dihydrate how does the j&j covid19 vaccine differ from mrna vaccines there are a couple of core differences the vaccines use a different mechanism to deliver the spike protein to elicit an immune response the mrna vaccines require specific cooling requirements that can make transportation difficult the mrna vaccines require two doses weeks apart to work effectively the j&j vaccine only requires one dose how effective is the j&j vaccine in the united states the vaccine was 744% effective and 72% effective in preventing moderate to severe/critical covid19 occurring at least 14 days and 28 days after vaccination respectively (1) has the j&j vaccine been tested is it safe yes while these may be new vaccines released in an emergent circumstance the us food and drug administration (fda) still has strict quality safety and efficacy requirements that janssen pfizerbiontech and moderna met (1) tens of thousands of individuals received the vaccines by participating in clinical studies to ensure the vaccines safety and efficacy (1) based on the current data all currently available vaccines are safe and effective in preventing severe covid19 infections has anyone died from getting the vaccine at the time of publication there are no confirmed cases of an individual dying due to any of the covid19 vaccines (1) there have been a handful of adverse reactions that have required immediate medical assistance so its important to talk with your doctor before getting vaccinated if you have a history of adverse reactions to vaccines sadly more than 500000 americans have died from complications related to covid19 infections who benefits most from the covid19 vaccines though society as a whole benefit from herd immunity which results from widespread vaccination there are subgroups that are more acutely impacted by covid19 infections adults 65 and older (1) individuals with medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic respiratory conditions obesity compromised immune systems and more (1) can anyone receive a vaccine which vaccine should i get at the time of publication the covid19 vaccine supply is still somewhat limited as production continues to gear up so government health agencies are prioritizing vaccine distribution based on an individuals risk factors occupation age and other specific criteria since supply is limited you should get whichever vaccine is available to you and recommended by your physician individuals whove had an allergic reaction to vaccines in the past or who have specific health conditions should speak with their doctor before receiving a vaccine how can i signup to get vaccinated at the time of publication vaccine distribution is routing through local health departments but may vary state to state to learn more about the covid19 vaccine distribution process in your area reach out to your local health department the good news we have another safe effective vaccine able to help protect us from covid19 additionally this singledose vaccine doesnt require specialized refrigeration which means more people can get the vaccine quicker and receive immunity benefits faster with widespread vaccination and other best health practices like hand washing maskwearing and social distancing we can stop the spread of covid19																
179	1	Covid19 vaccines safety and efficacy share on facebook share on twitter share via email covid19 vaccine photo getty images vaccines against covid19 have been developed at an unprecedented pace in pharmacies and vaccine centers they are now being administered as fast as the public health wheels can turn do they work are they safe do they involve animal testing or animal ingredients well tackle all of these questions do they work in human trials the pfizer vaccine was compared to a placebo in 43448 people during the study 170 participants developed covid19 when the study blind was broken it was revealed that 162 of these people had received the placebo only eight were in the vaccine group of 10 severe covid19 cases nine were in the placebo group and one had received the vaccine1 the moderna vaccine is similarly effective in 28207 participants there were 185 cases of covid19 in the placebo group and 11 cases in the vaccine group of 30 severe cases all were in the placebo group2 these figures show an effectiveness of over 90% the oneshot janssen vaccine released by johnson & johnson was reported to have an overall efficacy of 66% although its ability to prevent severe cases appears to be much higher3 some have speculated that the lower apparent efficacy of the janssen vaccine may be due to the arrival of variant coronaviruses that pose challenges for all current vaccines the pfizer vaccine is fragile it must be shipped and stored between 80 and 60 c when vaccines are not stored properly they can lose their effectiveness the moderna vaccine can be kept at more moderate temperatures but must still be shipped and stored correctly in order to work the janssen vaccine is stored with normal refrigeration the greatest unknown however is how long immunity may last particularly in the face of a mutating virus we do not yet know whether the coronavirus vaccines will provide longlasting protection like the salk polio vaccine or will lose its efficacy in a matter of months like influenza vaccines so far evidence suggests sustained immunity but only time will tell are they safe shortterm side effects of the pfizer moderna and janssen vaccines have been minimalfatigue headache and muscle aches rarely allergies have occurred typically in people with multiple previous allergies even so all pharmaceuticals have risks and they merit close monitoring while the salk polio vaccination has been shown to be extremely safe the live attenuated (sabin) vaccine can actually cause paralytic polioabout three cases of polio per million people vaccinated the problem is that the live virus used in the vaccine can revert back to a diseasecausing state leading to polio not in vaccinated individuals but in others to whom they pass the virus in 1976 the swine flu vaccine caused cases of guillainbarre syndrome a condition of weakness caused by an autoimmune reaction to the vaccine the syndrome is fatal in about 5% of cases and disabling in others there were 362 cases during the first six weeks of the vaccination program leading to its discontinuation concerns about covid19 vaccines have been fueled by the rush to create a workable vaccine the covid19 vaccines use methods that are far different from those used for polio or swine flu and evidence so far suggests that serious longterm side effects are extremely unlikely even so many consumers are taking a wait and see attitude deferring vaccination until more data are in are vaccines animaltested vaccine development usually involves years of testing often on animals before an investigational vaccine enters human trials the urgency of finding a covid19 vaccine allowed manufacturers to move into human trials with somewhat less animal testing than would otherwise have been required however government regulations will not allow vaccines to be administered to humans without animal testing the food and drug administration granted emergency use authorizations for pfizer and moderna based on safety and efficacy information obtained in studies using mice rats hamsters and monkeys as well as information from human clinical trials given the regulations and policies that mandate animal tests forthcoming covid19 vaccines will be tested on animals as well in addition all batches of injectable drugs including vaccines are tested for pyrogenicity that is their tendency to cause fever as a result of bacterial contamination historically such testing was conducted on rabbits in 1977 the fda approved a new test using the blood of horseshoe crabs (limulus) taking advantage of the fact that the crabs produce a protein that causes their blood to clot on contact with bacterial endotoxins the test proved faster and cheaper than rabbit tests and some argued it was more humane the crabs are taken from the sea bled and in theory returned to the sea the test is nonetheless traumatic and as many as 30% of the animals do not survive4 a newer method called the recombinant factor c assay uses proteins like those from crabs but produced in the laboratory5 it appears to be as accurate as the crabbased test with fewer false positives a second test the monocyte activation test is based on human blood cells unfortunately in contrast with the warp speed of vaccine development regulatory acceptance of the newer pyrogenicity tests has been at a horseandbuggy pace vaccine manufacturers so far have not revealed their pyrogenicity testing practices and continued use of the horseshoe crab test is likely the physicians committee is working directly with regulatory agencies to ensure that all batches of injectable drugs and vaccines including those against covid19 are tested without horseshoe crab blood do vaccines contain animal ingredients the pfizer moderna and janssen vaccines are free of animalderived ingredients in contrast to many other vaccines that include shark squalene gelatin cholesterol egg and milk pfizer has reported that its vaccine used a cows milk component in the manufacturing process but the vaccine does not contain this ingredient other vaccines are in latestage clinical trials all of which are produced by cells grown in a laboratory using animal products although animal products are not in the final vaccines themselves complete ingredient lists for forthcoming vaccine candidates are not likely to be made public until emergency use authorizations are submitted fortunately synthetic versions of most animalderived ingredients are readily available the physicians committee continues to work with the federal government and pharmaceutical companies to promote use of these nonanimal ingredients and for other critical changes to advance science and save human and animal lives more information about vaccine ingredients is available on the cdcs website what is the physicians committees policy in addition to working to improve testing policies as described above and our many programs highlighting the role of nutrition in the diseases that aggravate covid19 mortality the physicians committee and the barnard medical center have internal policies for disease prevention in addition to requiring the use of masks social distancing and good hygiene we also mandate covid19 vaccination for all clinic and research staffers who have contact of any sort with patients or research participants vaccines do have risks on the other hand the risks so far appear minimal while covid19 deaths are very real and climbing the older we or our families are the worse the odds unlike a dietrelated disease that is largely unaffected by an occasional lapse in caution coronaviruses take advantage of any gap they can find most of all we will retain our outward focus to try to change human behavior it was almost certainly the cruel exploitation of animalsin farms or live marketsthat brought the coronavirus into human populations and slaughterhouses were among the worst hot spots spreading the virus the virus is likely to mutate in live markets and fur farms while the meat and dairy industries fuel the epidemics of obesity diabetes and other dietrelated diseases that make covid19 a killer																
180	1	The new covid vaccines are safe heres how we know answers from a deep dive by jason silverstein dec 17 2020 cropped hand of doctor injecting syringe on patientmanjurul haque / eyeemgetty images as more than two people were dying in the united states every minute from covid19 the food and drug administrations advisory panel voted on thursday to recommend approval of the first vaccine for emergency use in people 16 and older now the first 29 million doses of pfizers covid19 vaccine are making their way across the country with the same number held in reserve for the booster twentyone days later and another half million banked for unexpected needs the first doses are expected to go to the nations 21 million healthcare workers and 3 million residents of longterm care facilities while vaccinesondemand at local pharmacies are bullseyed for april at the earliest more from mens health javelin press for shoulders | eb and swole play video next week the fdas advisory panel will reconvene to ask the same questions of the moderna vaccine which hopes to distribute 20 million doses by the end of the year heres what you need to know about how safe the vaccines are what side effects to expect and why the vaccine is in no way worse than the disease itself how safe are these vaccines really while the covid19 vaccine process has moved at an unprecedented pace (both pfizer and moderna began work on their vaccines only eleven months ago) there are three strong reasons to trust that they are safe 1) we have more information that we ordinarily have about vaccines before they are released each of these vaccines is enrolling 30000 to 60000 per trial and there are six vaccine candidates said grace lee md professor of pediatrics at stanford university school of medicine that is a lot of information that we are going to have 2) pfizers clinical data shows no serious side effects for the 38000 participants in its trial and most of the mild side effects happening to participants under age 55 pfizers vaccine appears to be 95 percent effective at preventing disease and in its trial only one participant developed severe disease likewise according to its data modernas vaccine prevents 945 percent of cases and its trial reported no cases of severe disease 3) a major reason why these vaccines are so safe is that they are both using firstofitskind messenger rna (mrna) technology what this means is that the vaccine is able to trick our body into producing the same protein that is on top of the coronavirus which causes the body to mount an immune response neither vaccine uses the actual live coronavirus that means it is impossible to get covid19 from either vaccine are there side effects what everyone needs to understand before getting either vaccine is that side effects are very common especially after the second shot and go away in a day or two mens health mvp dont miss exclusive content join now mens health nearly eightyfive percent of people had a reaction at the injection site almost twothirds experienced fatigue and more than half had headaches in the pfizer trial the moderna vaccine also shows the majority of people having similar reactions for both vaccines the most intense side effects happened after the second shot though people who have gotten the both shots say the symptoms did not last long since the vaccine rollout began in the us and uk some severe allergic reactions have been reported including two at the same hospital in alaska (one was an anaphylactic reaction) both people have reportedly recovered as have two uk healthcare workers who also had anaphylactic reactions paul a offit md director of the vaccine education center and an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at childrens hospital of philadelphia is quoted in the new york times as saying he didnt think vaccine distribution should be paused but that scientists need to figure out what part of the vaccine might be responsible for the reaction the cdc recommends that all recipients to wait 15 minutes before leaving to be monitored for reactions and people with a history of anaphylaxis should be closely monitored for 30 minutes after receiving the injection should you stay away if you have a history of allergies to a food medicine or vaccine stay away the cdc says that while these reactions are being investigated it considers a history of severe allergic reaction (eg anaphylaxis) to any other vaccine or injectable therapy (eg intramuscular intravenous or subcutaneous) as a precaution but not a contraindication to vaccination yesterday anthony fauci md the nations top infectious diseases expert said in an interview with cnbc that so with the pfizer people are saying that if you have a history of a severe allergic reaction you should either not take this vaccine or if you do take it take it in the context of a place where if you do develop an allergic reaction it could be readily and effectively treated what about safety in younger people there does however remain a question mark for some experts about the safety of the vaccine for 16 and 17yearolds the vaccines and related biological products advisory committee voted 174 with one abstaining to recommend that the fda authorize the emergency use of the pfizer covid19 vaccine the four who voted against the motion presumably did so out of the concerns about a lack of data on this age group but the uncertainty about the safety for 16 and 17yearolds while not unfounded is moot according to former fda chair and pfizer board member scott gottlieb md that is because these young people will not be eligible to receive the vaccine right away anyway giving us plenty of time to study related story who gets the covid19 vaccine first the takeaway here is this a few days with a sore arm and a headache is a small price to pay to help stop a disease that has killed more than a quarter million people in the country where we are in the pandemic is terrible right now said dr lee how will we know if a rare side effect happens there are systems in place that are designed to catch any rare side effects which we would not necessarily see in 30000 patients but would in 30 million or 300 million how we will know if something is going terribly wrong is through a combination of passive and active surveillance explained sonali kochhar md clinical associate professor at the university of washington seattle passive surveillance is when we collect reports of adverse events as patients report them and active surveillance seeks out those events the united states does both this content is imported from {embedname} you may be able to find the same content in another format or you may be able to find more information at their web site multiple surveillance systems are at work including largescale systems like cdcs vaccine safety datalink and fdas sentinel programs said sophia newcomer phd assistant professor of epidemiology at the university of montana these and other surveillance systems have worked for decades to ensure the safety of vaccines in the us monitoring the safety of covid19 vaccines will not be their first rodeo the cdc currently lists five different surveillance systems that are in place in addition there is a new way to report symptoms through text messaging called vsafe a cdc program that also provides reminders on when to get the second dose but wont the vaccine make me sicker than actually having covid19 nearly half of americans say they either are not sure if they will take the vaccine or do not plan on getting it according to a survey from the associated pressnorc center for public affairs research that would be a tragic development since we need to give the vaccine to at least 63 percent of the population to reach immunity in the population most of the people who say they do not want to get vaccinated explain their fear with a dangerous misunderstanding of the vaccines including four out of ten who believe they can catch the disease from the vaccine which is impossible because again the vaccine does not use the live virus related story 9 questions about the covid vaccines answered other surveys have also shown that people believe that the side effects caused by the vaccine may be worse than getting the disease itself a misbelief that almost certainly will result in people dying experts say that people with a history of severe allergies should consult with their doctors about getting vaccinated and how to prepare for the visit if they choose the vaccine although the risk is much higher in elderly people young people die of this disease too said robert finberg md chair of the department of medicine at the university of massachusetts to think it is better to get the disease is a real misunderstanding not only has covid19 killed at least 6300 people under 45 so far but those who survive often face difficult recoveries if the fear of being killed is not enough to inspire young people to get the vaccine the fear of killing someone else should cdc data has shown that increases in cases among young people predict increases in cases among people over 60 and recent data says that there has been an increase in cases among young people a potentially deadly foreshadowing young and otherwise healthy people who arent healthcare workers wont have a choice about getting a vaccine until the spring but when the option is there the decision is clear your sore arm will save a life by getting vaccinated you are protecting yourself your parents and grandparents your elderly neighbors the people you work with who have chronic conditions said newcomer getting vaccinated may seem like a small individual action but it has a large positive collective impact																
181	1	Covid19 vaccine myths debunked december 9 2020 a young black woman and young black man sitting together on a couch looking seriously at information on a computer and reading paper documents a vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (covid19) is perhaps the best hope for ending the pandemic a number of biopharmaceutical companies have applied for us food and drug administration (fda) emergency use authorization for a new covid19 vaccine and a limited number of vaccines will be available before the end of the year it is likely that you have heard claims about the covid19 vaccine on social media or from people in your life the quick development and approval of a vaccine may increase your hesitancy about its safety or effectiveness lets set the record straight on circulating myths about the covid19 vaccine myth the covid19 vaccine is not safe because it was rapidly developed and tested fact many pharmaceutical companies invested significant resources into quickly developing a vaccine for covid19 because of the worldwide impact of the pandemic the emergency situation warranted an emergency response but that does not mean that companies bypassed safety protocols or didnt perform adequate testing mayo clinic will recommend the use of those vaccines that we are confident are safe while there are many covid19 vaccine candidates in development early interim data are encouraging for the pfizer vaccine which likely is to be the first authorized for emergency use by the fda in the late december/early january timeframe this vaccine was created using a novel technology based on the molecular structure of the virus the novel methodology to develop a covid19 vaccine allows it to be free from materials of animal origin and synthesized by an efficient cellfree process without preservatives this vaccine developed by pfizer/biontech has been studied in approximately 43000 people to receive emergency use authorization the biopharmaceutical manufacturer must have followed at least half of the study participants for at least two months after completing the vaccination series and the vaccine must be proven safe and effective in that population in addition to the safety review by the fda the advisory committee on immunization has convened a panel of vaccine safety experts to independently evaluate the safety data from the clinical trial mayo clinic vaccine experts also will review the available data the safety of covid19 vaccine will continue to be closely monitored by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and the fda myth i already had covid19 and recovered so i dont need to get a covid19 vaccine when its available fact there is not enough information currently available to say if or for how long after infection someone is protected from getting covid19 again this is called natural immunity early evidence suggests natural immunity from covid19 may not last very long but more studies are needed to better understand this mayo clinic recommends getting the covid19 vaccine even if youve had covid19 previously however those that had covid19 should delay vaccination until about 90 days from diagnosis people should not get vaccinated if in quarantine after exposure or if they have covid19 symptoms myth there are severe side effects of the covid19 vaccines fact there are shortterm mild or moderate vaccine reactions that resolve without complication or injury the early phase studies of the pfizer vaccine show that it is safe about 15% of people developed short lived symptoms at the site of the injection 50% developed systemic reactions primarily headache chills fatigue or muscle pain or fever lasting for a day or two keep in mind that these side effects are indicators that your immune system is responding to the vaccine and are common when receiving vaccines myth i wont need to wear a mask after i get the covid19 vaccine fact it may take time for everyone who wants a covid19 vaccination to get one also while the vaccine may prevent you from getting sick it is unknown at this time if you can still carry and transmit the virus to others until more is understood about how well the vaccine works continuing with precautions such as maskwearing and physical distancing will be important myth more people will die as a result of a negative side effect to the covid19 vaccine than would actually die from the virus fact circulating on social media is the claim that covid19s mortality rate is 1%2% and that people should not be vaccinated against a virus with a high survival rate however a 1% mortality rate is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu in addition the mortality rate can vary widely and is influenced by age sex and underlying health condition while some people that receive the vaccine may develop symptoms as their immune system responds remember that this is common when receiving any vaccine and not considered serious or lifethreatening you cannot get covid19 infection from the covid19 vaccines they are inactivated vaccines and not live viruses its important to recognize that getting the vaccine is not just about survival from covid19 its about preventing spread of the virus to others and preventing infection that can lead to longterm negative health effects while no vaccine is 100% effective they are far better than not getting a vaccine the benefits certainly outweigh the risks in healthy people myth the covid19 vaccine was developed as a way to control the general population either through microchip tracking or nano transducers in our brains fact there is no vaccine microchip and the vaccine will not track people or gather personal information into a database this myth started after comments made by bill gates from the gates foundation about a digital certificate of vaccine records the technology he was referencing is not a microchip has not been implemented in any manner and is not tied to the development testing or distribution of the covid19 vaccine myth the covid19 vaccine will alter my dna fact the first covid19 vaccines to reach the market are likely to be messenger rna (mrna) vaccines according to the cdc mrna vaccines work by instructing cells in the body how to make a protein that triggers an immune response injecting mrna into your body will not interact or do anything to the dna of your cells human cells break down and get rid of the mrna soon after they have finished using the instructions myth covid19 vaccines were developed using fetal tissue fact neither the pfizer/biontech covid19 vaccine nor the moderna covid19 vaccines contain fetal cells nor were fetal cells used in the development or production of either vaccine myth covid19 vaccines cause infertility or miscarriage fact no covid19 vaccines have not been linked to infertility or miscarriage a sophisticated disinformation campaign has been circulating online claiming that antibodies to the spike protein of covid19 produced from these vaccines will bind to placental proteins and prevent pregnancy this disinformation is thought to originate from internet postings by a former scientist known to hold antivaccine views these postings are not scientifically plausible as covid19 infection has not been linked to infertility also no other viral infection or vaccinationinducing immunity by similar mechanisms has been shown to cause infertility antibodies to the spike protein have not been linked to infertility after covid19 infection there is no scientific reason to believe this will change after vaccination for covid19 while there are no formal studies the best evidence comes from women who got sick with covid19 while pregnant while data clearly indicate pregnant women are at higher risk of hospitalization due to covid19 infection there is no evidence of increased miscarriage rates during natural infection the immune system generates the same antibodies to the spike protein that covid19 vaccines would thus if covid19 affected fertility there already would be an increase in miscarriage rates in women infected with covid19 this has not happened myth i am allergic to eggs so i shouldnt get the covid19 vaccine fact neither the pfizer/biontech covid19 vaccine nor the moderna covid19 vaccines contain egg nor were eggs used the development or production of either vaccine however those with severe allergic reactions to eggs or any other substance (ie anaphylaxis) are encouraged to remain after vaccination for 30 minutes for observation myth covid19 vaccines must be stored at extremely low temperatures because of preservatives in the vaccines fact pfizer/biontech and moderna have reported that their vaccines contain no preservatives different vaccines have different storage requirements for instance the pfizer/biontech vaccine must be stored at minus 94 degrees fahrenheit (minus 70 degrees celsius) while moderna has said that its vaccine needs to be stored at minus 4 degrees fahrenheit (minus 20 degrees celsius) both of these vaccines use messenger rna or mrna to teach your cells how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response to covid19 however messenger rna is fragile and can break down easily storing messenger rna vaccines like these covid19 vaccines in an ultracold environment keeps them stable and safe you should not worry about these temperatures vaccines are thawed before injection																
182	1	Covid19 advice for the public getting vaccinated english version last updated on 13 april 2022 safe and effective vaccines are available that provide strong protection against serious illness hospitalization and death from covid19  billions of people have been vaccinated against covid19 getting vaccinated is one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself against covid19 help end the pandemic and stop new variants emerging take all covid19 vaccine doses recommended to you by your health authority as soon as it is your turn including a booster dose if recommended it is still possible to get covid19 and spread it to others after being vaccinated so continue to do everything you can to keep yourself and others healthy continue keeping a safe distance from others and avoiding crowds wearing a wellfitting mask covering your mouth and nose keeping indoor spaces well ventilated cleaning hands regularly and covering coughs and sneezes if you do get covid19 after vaccination you are more likely to have mild or no symptoms than if you hadnt been vaccinated as of 8 april 2022 who has evaluated that the following vaccines against covid19 have met the necessary criteria for safety and efficacy astrazeneca/oxford vaccine johnson and johnson moderna pfizer/biontech sinopharm sinovac covaxin covovax nuvaxovid cansino read our q&a on the emergency use listing process to find out more about how who assesses the quality safety and efficacy of covid19 vaccines some national regulators have also assessed other covid19 vaccine products for use in their countries take whatever vaccine is made available to you first even if you have already had covid19 it is important to be vaccinated as soon as possible once its your turn and not wait it is safe and effective to mixandmatch different covid19 vaccines the current covid19 vaccines provide strong protection against serious illness and death caused by the omicron and delta variants of the virus that causes covid19 being fully vaccinated will also help reduce the likelihood of new variants emerging for more information on booster doses and mixingandmatching vaccines please read our covid19 vaccines q&a and covid19 vaccines safety q&a who should get vaccinated covid19 vaccines with who eul are safe for most people 18 years and older including those with preexisting conditions including autoimmune disorders these conditions include hypertension diabetes asthma pulmonary liver and kidney disease as well as chronic infections that are stable and controlled if you are pregnant want to get pregnant in the future or are currently breastfeeding getting vaccinated is important to protect you and your current or future family many people around the world have now been vaccinated against covid19 while pregnant or breastfeeding and no safety concerns have been identified for them or their babies in fact getting vaccinated while pregnant helps to protect your baby this may also be the case if you get vaccinated while breastfeeding you should still get vaccinated if you are menstruating on the day of your appointment if you are immunocompromised you should be prioritised for an additional dose of covid19 vaccine after 1 to 3 months people with compromised immune systems dont always develop sufficient immunity against covid19 after one or two doses so an additional dose can help to protect them you should also get a booster dose if recommended there is growing evidence that children can be safely vaccinated against covid19 check the covid19 vaccines q&a page or the information pages on each vaccine for advice on what agespecific guidance is in place for that vaccine if you are aged 60 and over and are vaccinated with sinovac or sinopharm you should be offered a third dose after 3  6 months people over 60 have been found to develop less protection after two doses of these vaccines than younger people getting a third dose can help provide higher immunity you should also get a booster dose when it is your turn who should not get vaccinated it is safe for most people to get vaccinated against covid19 however you should not be vaccinated if you have a history of severe allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to any of the ingredients of the covid19 vaccine in order to avoid possible adverse effects you have a fever over 385oc on the day of your vaccine appointment postpone until you have recovered you currently have confirmed or suspected covid19 wait until you have completed the mandated isolation period and your acute symptoms have passed to get vaccinated if you are on blood thinners it is safe for you to get vaccinated but let the person vaccinating you know what to expect after getting vaccinated some people will experience mild side effects after being vaccinated against covid19 common side effects to covid19 vaccines include a fever head or body aches and a sore arm these symptoms usually go away within a day or two you can manage any side effects with rest plenty of nonalcoholic liquids and taking medication to manage pain and fever if needed we do not recommend taking medication for pain before being vaccinated as we dont know how this will affect how well the vaccine works contact your health care provider if you are worried about any of the side effects that you are experiencing more serious or longlasting side effects to covid19 vaccines are extremely rare if you experience difficulty breathing chest pain confusion loss of speech or mobility after your vaccine contact your healthcare provider immediately vaccines are continually monitored to detect and respond to rare adverse events it takes several weeks after each dose of covid19 vaccine for your body to develop maximum levels of immunity  you are not protected right away we still dont know exactly how long protection from covid19 vaccines lasts but most people have strong protection against serious illness and death for at least 6 months as who understands more about covid19 vaccines we will be updating our recommendations accordingly and keeping the information on this page updated have more questions about getting vaccinated against covid19 check out the answers to the most frequently asked questions in the q&as below																
183	1	Large realworld study pfizers covid vaccine is safe filed under covid19 mary van beusekom | news writer | cidrap news | aug 26 2021 share tweet linkedin email print & pdf upside_down_pfizer_vax_viaintl_monetary_fundjpg upsidedown pfizer covid vaccine vial international monetary fund ernesto benevidas / flickr cc the largest realworld study of a covid19 vaccine to date shows that pfizer/biontechs shot is safe and linked to substantially fewer adverse events than sarscov2 infection in unvaccinated patients a team led by researchers from the clalit research institute in tel aviv israel and harvard university matched vaccinated israelis 16 years and older (median age 38) with similar but unvaccinated people infected with sarscov2 from dec 20 2020 to may 24 2021 they then derived risk ratios (rrs) and risk differences 42 days after vaccination (short to mediumterm) using the kaplanmeier estimator the analysis of the pfizer vaccine which the us food and drug administration fully approved earlier this week involved 17 million vaccinated and 233000 unvaccinated people the vaccine was determined to be safe with only 4 of the 25 potential side effects that the group examined strongly associated with the vaccine while the vaccine was associated with a 324 rr (or more than triple the risk) for myocarditis or inflammation of the heart muscle it was still rare in contrast the rr for the condition in unvaccinated covid19 patients was 1828 these results show convincingly that this mrna vaccine is very safe and that the alternative of natural morbidity caused by the coronavirus puts a person at significant higher and much more common risk of serious adverse events senior study author ran balicer md phd said in a clalit research institute news release these data should facilitate informed individual riskbenefit decisionmaking and in our view make a strong argument in favor of optingin to get vaccinated especially in countries where the virus is currently widespread he added risk of myocarditis much higher with covid the strongest tie between the vaccine and an adverse event was myocarditis with an excess risk of 1 to 5 events per 100000 people an rr of 324 (95% confidence interval [ci] 155 to 1244) and a risk difference of 27 events per 100000 (95% ci 10 to 46) myocarditis after vaccination was seen mostly in men aged 20 to 34 in contrast previous sarscov2 infection among unvaccinated patients was associated with a significantly elevated risk of myocarditis (rr 1828 [95% ci 395 to 2512] risk difference 110 events per 100000 persons [95% ci 56 to 158] other vaccinelinked adverse events included swollen lymph nodes (rr 243 [95% ci 205 to 278] risk difference 784 events per 100000 persons [95% ci 641 to 893] appendicitis (rr 140 [95% ci 102 to 201] risk difference 50 events per 100000 persons [95% ci 03 to 99] and herpes zoster infection or shingles (rr 143 [95% ci 120 to 173] risk difference 158 events per 100000 persons [95% ci 82 to 242]) the increased risk of bells palsy (facialnerve palsy) was small (rr 132) previous sarscov2 infections were also associated with multiple serious adverse events in addition to myocarditis including pericarditis (inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart) heart rhythm abnormalities deep vein thrombosis (blood clot) pulmonary embolism (blood clot that travels to a lung artery) heart attack intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding inside the skull) and thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count) the authors quantified the covid19related risks thus abnormal heart rhythms (a 38fold increase or an increase of 166 cases per 100000 infected patients) kidney damage (148fold increase 125 excess cases per 100000) pericarditis (54fold increase 11 excess cases per 100000) pulmonary embolism (121fold increase 62 excess cases per 100000) deep vein thrombosis (38fold increase 43 excess cases per 100000) heart attack (45fold increase 25 excess cases per 100000) and stroke (21fold increase 14 excess cases per 100000) assuaging vaccine fears the study was the largest peerreviewed assessment of the safety of a covid19 vaccine in the setting of a nationwide mass vaccination according to the authors they noted that previous vaccine safety evaluation efforts have relied on vaccinated individual selfreports which are incomplete marc lipsitch phd of harvard study coauthor said in the release that the big challenge in vaccine safety studies is ensuring that those we are comparing to identify the vaccines side effects are similar in the other characteristics that may predict whether they will experience these side effects which he said is particularly difficult in the context of a rapidly growing agetargeted vaccine campaign clalits extraordinary database made it possible to design a study that addressed these challenges in a way that provides tremendous confidence in the inferences that come out of the study he added coauthor ben reis phd of harvard said that the study results should assuage vaccine hesitancy due to lack of potential information on possible vaccinerelated adverse events those who have hesitated until now to get vaccinated due to concerns about very rare side effectssuch as myocarditisshould be aware that the risks for this very same side effect are actually higher among unvaccinated infected individuals he said																
184	1	How safe is the vaccine millions of americans have safely gotten vaccinated against covid19 however because these vaccines are relatively new and the target of misinformation online there may be apprehension about vaccine safety and efficacy weve asked our yale new haven health experts to help clarify what we know about the vaccines and their current safety profiles what do we know about the safety of the available vaccines all of the data that are available indicate that the pfizer moderna and johnson & johnson vaccines are safe the pfizer vaccine which was granted full approval by the fda consists of genetic material called mrna which stimulates the immune system to protect against the virus the vaccine material breaks down quickly after its absorbed into cells and it does not impact our genes the moderna vaccine which also has full approval by the fda works in the same way the covid19 vaccines are new but rna vaccines have been around for the better part of the last decade experts have been researching this method to develop vaccines against other illnesses including influenza ebola and the zika virus those years of scientific development helped researchers get to the point where we are today the johnson & johnson vaccine is different from the pfizer and moderna vaccines and only requires a single dose after a multistep process to approve a vaccine the fda along with the cdc will continue to monitor the safety of covid19 vaccines to rapidly detect safety problems if they exist any time a new vaccine is presented to the fda its tested and reviewed thoroughly before approval even if its for emergency use said thomas balcezak md chief medical officer for yale new haven health in addition to the fdas review connecticuts governor has a vaccine advisory committee to review the data the group which includes richard martinello md medical director of infection prevention for yale new haven health recommended the immediate distribution of the vaccine what are the side effects yale new haven health participated in the pfizer vaccine trial which included around 40000 participants during the course of that trial no serious side effects were reported some mild side effects associated with the pfizer vaccine can include a local reaction to the vaccination site such as mild pain redness or swelling similar side effects can occur with the moderna and johnson & johnson vaccines as well those mild reactions sometimes happen with other vaccines like the flu shot to alleviate those minor symptoms an ice pack can reduce soreness or swelling a cool bath drinking fluids and taking an over the counter pain reliever if approved by your doctor could also be helpful other side effects can include fever chills fatigue headache muscle pain and joint pain some people get side effects from vaccines because they tickle the immune system provoking a response that just means the vaccine is working and its not a reason to be alarmed because there is no live or dead virus in the vaccine you cannot get covid19 from it as with any vaccine there is a very remote chance that it can cause a severe allergic reaction serious injury or death any time someone experiences emergency symptoms such as trouble breathing pain or pressure in the chest confusion bluish lips or face or any other sudden and severe symptom they should call 911 how effective is the vaccine the pfizer vaccine is a 2shot series it is about 95% effective within one week of getting the second dose its only around 53% effective after the first dose which is why its important for all recipients to get the second dose the moderna vaccine has a similar efficacy which is about the same as many common immunizations to protect against illnesses like polio and measles a third dose of the pfizer and moderna vaccines are recommended for those with certain immunocompromising conditions a booster dose is also recommended to help increase protection against the virus this vaccine is safe and effective the pandemic has taken a toll on everyone but the availability of a vaccine with such an impressive efficacy is a testament to the researchers who have worked on this technology for years said dr balcezak johnson & johnson found its vaccine was 72% effective in the us and 66% effective overall in preventing severe cases 28 days after vaccination another covid19 vaccine by astrazeneca is about 63% effective and uses a different technology than the pfizer and moderna vaccines the world health organization granted emergency authorization for this vaccine but it has not yet been approved for emergency use by the fda in the us so far the fda predicts the pfizer vaccine will be effective for several months and possibly a year in the meantime experts will continue to study the virus and the vaccines developed to fight it there may be some scenarios where some people may need to consult with their doctor before getting the vaccine for example anyone who is currently sick with covid19 should wait before getting it																
185	1	Why its safe and important to get the covid19 vaccine by savannah koplon january 15 2021 print email editors note the information published in this story is accurate at the time of publication always refer to uabedu/uabunited for uabs current guidelines and recommendations relating to covid19 from side an unidentified female health care worker is wearing a safety vest ppe (personal protective equipment) gloves and face mask is administering the influenza vaccination to a male patient wearing a face mask and sitting in a parked automobile at the drivethru flu shot event in the 12th street parking deck at the community health services building during the covid19 (coronavirus disease) pandemic november 2020 now that effective vaccines for covid19 have been developed and are being distributed to members of the public it is key for folks to understand the benefits of the covid19 vaccines and why they greatly outweigh mild potential side effects or inconvenience that may be associated the possibility of serious complications for anyone who gets the virus  along with the public health consequences of the pandemics continuing its course  are strong reasons in favor of getting vaccinated explains michael saag md professor of medicine in the university of alabama at birmingham division of infectious diseases but what else should the public know the covid19 vaccination will help keep you from getting the virus covid19 vaccines were evaluated in clinical trials and have been approved because those studies show that the vaccine significantly reduces the probability of contracting the virus based on what has been proved about vaccines for other diseases the covid19 vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get the virus getting vaccinated also may protect people around you  particularly those at greater risk for severe illness from covid19 saag says the true value of the vaccine is more easily seen when we consider what would happen if the development of a vaccine had failed we would be faced with an exploding pandemic for which there was no end in sight saag said it might continue to burn through the population for another two to four years he compares the rapid development of a safe highly effective vaccine to both a home run and an event that might be seen as divine intervention first scientists developed the strategy and drug quickly saag explained second the resulting vaccine works at an almost unprecedented level of effectiveness third the sideeffect profile is the same as for most vaccines you may get aches and fever that are gone in 36 hours on average so this is a walkoff grandslam home run in the last game of the world series that you rarely witness in medicine if you are a uab employee who would like to receive a vaccine register here covid19 vaccination is an important tool to help stop the pandemic stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools we have available wearing masks and social distancing help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others but these measures are not enough vaccines work with your immune system so it will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed the combination of getting vaccinated and following cdc recommendations to protect yourself and others provides the best protection from covid19 ending the covid19 pandemic will halt the growing negative impact the virus is having on education the economy health care and countless other activities of a functioning society saag notes that the public health benefit of the vaccine is the main reason for its use this is how we end the pandemic full stop saag said once that is done we can have a normal society again we can enjoy daily life family events work and school without distancing without masks and without fear we will once again enjoy regular shopping trips and dining out and family vacations without constant worry about the consequences we can have real holiday activities instead of virtual ones its very simple we will get our lives back the vaccines do not affect or interact with our dna in any way the covid19 vaccines are a new type known as mrna (messenger rna) vaccines these mrna vaccines give instructions to our cells to make a harmless piece of what is called the spike protein the spike protein is found on the surface of the virus covid19 mrna never enters the nucleus of the cell which is where dna (genetic material) is stored once the instructions are inside your muscle cells the cells use them to make the protein piece then the cells break down the instructions and get rid of them next the cell places the protein piece on its surface the immune system spots the protein and begins building an immune response and making antibodies to fight the infection at the end of this process our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection are you in a group designated by the adph qualified to received your vaccine register for a vaccine through uab here covid19 vaccination is a safer way to help build protection covid19 can bring upon serious lifethreatening complications as hospitals like uab are seeing in hundreds of patients daily who need hospitalized care even though it affects certain groups less seriously than others based on age health and other factors it is still not possible to predict how covid19 will affect any individual getting covid19 may offer some natural protection known as immunity but experts do not know how long that immunity lasts and the risk of severe illness and death from covid19 far outweighs any benefits of natural immunity getting vaccinated creates an antibody response so that you are protected without having to experience the illness both natural immunity and immunity produced by a vaccine are important aspects of covid19 that experts are investigating health care officials and agencies plan to keep the public informed about new developments saag says getting infected with the covid19 virus is the least desirable and least safe way to develop immunity providing context as both a clinician and covid19 survivor it was harrowing i was scared for eight days about what the next day would bring saag said i would watch my oxygen level drop i knew what i was in store for if i had to be hospitalized and undergo intensive care each day i would get up feeling better thinking i had beat this thing only to have the symptoms spike again in the evening it was like the repeated scenes in groundhog day for eight nights that kind of experience which as we know not everyone survives can be prevented with the vaccine so it makes complete sense to get the vaccine																
186	1	Covid19 vaccine safety what to know side effects are normal you cannot get covid19 from the vaccine however like other vaccines you may feel some side effects these are signs the vaccine is working for twodose vaccines side effects after the second shot may be worse if possible give yourself time to rest and recover in the day or two after getting the shot for covid19 vaccines that need two doses make sure you get your second dose you wont be fully protected until two weeks after your second dose 1 centers for disease control and prevention safety of covid19 vaccines march 25 2021

effective for children people who are pregnant and those with underlying conditions as more people get vaccinated we will keep getting more data on safety and side effects data show the covid19 vaccines are safe and serious side effects are rare talk to a health care provider or clinic worker if you have concerns about getting vaccinated allergies  the cdc recommends the vaccine for anyone who is not allergic to any ingredient in the vaccine  allergic reactions to the covid19 vaccines are often thought to be caused by fats in the vaccine called polyethylene glycol (peg) and polysorbate  the vaccines do not have common allergens like those found in food so most other allergies should not be a concern when getting the covid19 vaccine for example the vaccines are eggfree latexfree and preservativefree ethics the covid19 vaccine ingredients are safe and needed for the vaccines to do their job one piece of the johnson & johnson vaccine is made inside of labgrown copies of cells that originally came from elective abortions that took place over 35 years ago many other vaccines including chickenpox rubella and hepatitis a are made the same way none of the vaccines contain human cells (including fetal cells) the covid19 virus latex preservatives or any animal byproducts including pork products or gelatin the vaccines are not grown in eggs and contain no egg products medical conditions  studies showed the covid19 vaccines were just as safe and effective in people with medical conditions twenty to 45 percent of participants in each of the vaccine trials had conditions like obesity diabetes heart disease liver disease and hiv  we have limited safety data on vaccine use in people with weakened immune systems or autoimmune conditions the cdc still recommends the vaccine for these groups because they have a higher risk of severe illness if they get covid19  medical experts in pregnancy and birth recommend the covid19 vaccine for people who are pregnant lactating or planning to get pregnant data show the covid19 vaccines are safe during pregnancy in fact some studies show that a vaccinated parent can even pass antibodies against covid19 along to their baby through pregnancy and lactation pregnant people are at risk for severe illness from covid19 including death the vaccines are the best protection																
187	1	Covid19 vaccines and their longterm safety 8 november 2021 getting vaccinated is one of the best things we can do to protect ourselves and our community against the worst of covid19 weve seen this in the vaccine rollout across the globe as those who are fully vaccinated are much less likely to die or suffer severe covid19 while there is an extremely rare risk of serious adverse reactions in the short term the health risks of not getting the vaccine are much higher when considering the benefits of getting vaccinated you may have wondered how we can be confident in the longterm safety of covid19 vaccines especially the newer mrna vaccines that were developed recently experiences from previous vaccination programs and evidence about the current vaccines give scientists and regulators confidence that the vaccines approved for use in australia are very unlikely to cause harm in the long term in this article well take a look at why they can be confident in the longterm safety a health practitioner smiles while placing a bandaid on a persons upper armvaccination is one of the most effective ways to reduce the harms of covid19 image adapted from heather hazzan via flickr cc20 in australia there are currently three covid19 vaccines provisionally approved for use the pfizer/biontech vaccine (comirnaty) the astrazeneca vaccine (vaxzevria) and most recently the moderna vaccine (spikevax) they have all passed the rigorous checks and balances required by the therapeutic goods administration (tga) to do so they must have shown high safety quality and efficacy in all clinical trials in addition there is continued monitoring of how they perform in the real world after approval to identify any rare or delayed side effects efficacy efficacy (prounounced ehfehkuhsee) is the reduction in clinical signs of disease due to vaccination as shown in research studies carried out under controlled conditions such as randomised clinical trials are there longterm unwanted impacts of covid19 vaccines there is no scientific evidence to suggest that the current covid19 vaccines will cause longterm problems in years to come and in this case where theres been rigorous research on the topic no news is good news a vaccine works by preparing your immune system to protect you against the virus without the harmful effects of the infection itself that means it is a bit like a dress rehearsal so that if your body is exposed to the virus it is better equipped to fight the infection minor side effects may occur within a few days of receiving the vaccine as the immune system is learning how to recognise and respond to the virus minor side effects may include symptoms such as general tiredness fever and muscle aches and pain at the site of injection symptoms are usually mild and shortlived its best to look at reliable information on the specific vaccine youre receiving to find out more about possible side effects and to speak to your doctor or a health professional if you have any concerns we know that the immune system works very quickly so if there are serious unexpected side effects from a vaccine these will usually occur in the first 48 hours or at most in the first few months not years after vaccination the technologies and science behind covid19 vaccines have been decades in the making so although it may seem as if scientists took only a short time to develop them theyve actually been doing the preparation work for years while it is true that covid19 mrna vaccines are the first mrna vaccines to be licensed for use the development of mrna vaccines began over three decades ago even before covid19 was detected scientists had been studying coronavirusesa family of viruses that includes sars mers and the common cold as well as covid19and how we may be able to vaccinate against them research from serious infectious disease outbreaks such as mers in 2012 and sars in 2003 also provided a head start for covid19 vaccine development people walking on a busy street some have face masks onall covid19 vaccines were tested for safety on thousands of people before they went to market and are continuously monitored after rollout image adapted from mat napo via unsplash cc0 thanks to the ongoing monitoring of billions of people around the world receiving these vaccines even extremely rare side effects can be detected this is how the very rare blood clotting condition thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts) was picked up it took millions of vaccinations for the condition to be detected when some cases were reported in people mostly within a month of receiving the astrazeneca vaccine there have also been rare cases of anaphylaxis and a heart inflammation condition that were linked to the pfizer vaccine in this way however it must be noted that the risks of clotting and heart conditions are much much higher with covid19 infection than risks associated with any current vaccine can mrna covid19 vaccines alter a persons dna lets look specifically at mrna vaccines could the particles injected from vaccines alter our dna years down the track or become absorbed into our genetic makeup in short nomrna vaccines are very unlikely to alter your dna in either the short or long term both the pfizer and moderna covid19 vaccines use messengerrna (mrna) technology mrna is a vital part of every living thing and acts as the translator or messenger of information between dna and the cell cytoplasm where proteins are made if you imagine dna is a recipe book with all instructions for life then each strand of mrna is a photocopy of one recipe from within that book and the protein is the final dish created by the ribosomes (the cells chefs) in this cooking analogy the ribosomes read the photocopied recipe rather than in the valuable book itself so the book remains unaltered a diagram shows dna > mrna > protein mrna is the messenger between dna and the proteins that are coded by that dna image australian academy of science cc20 mrna vaccines once injected into a persons body deliver only part of the sarscov2 mrna the part that codes for the viruss unique spike protein your cells ribosomes recognise the mrna code and use it to create a replica of the spike protein the spike protein of the virus wont cause harm as it is only one part of the viruss outer shellits role is to bind to other cells and to enter the bodys systems by giving your cells ribosomes the instructions to make replica spike proteins the mrna vaccine helps your body prepare an immune response so that it can attack the spike protein when it sees it again such as if you are exposed to covid19 the vaccine mrna then rapidly degrades in your body just as all other mrnas do normally in any living cell mrna actually has a very short halflife (length of time needed for it to break down) because once its messenger job is done it is no longer needed mrna is naturally unstable and our cells have many different ways of degrading it the mrna is completely destroyed after this process and leaves the body within a few days while some viruses such as hiv can turn their shortlived rna photocopies into stable chapters that will insert themselves into an infected cells recipe book the sarscov2 virus that causes covid19 cant do that and neither can the mrna vaccines if you are worried about your health in the long term the best thing you can do is get vaccinated to protect yourself against covid19 the technology behind mrna vaccines is really useful because it allows more rapid development and adaptation of vaccines and doesnt rely on cultivating a live virus for example mrna vaccines may be able to be quickly altered to better target different variants of covid19 if variants that make the vaccines less effective were to arise from years of research on vaccines genetics and different coronaviruses along with the massive combined international effort of monitoring and reporting on side effects of covid19 vaccines we can conclude that there arent likely to be significant longterm side effects from covid19 vaccines whether they use mrna or traditional vaccine technologies safety has been a key priority it must be noted however that serious longterm impacts of the actual covid19 infection occur in up to one in three cases of infection so if you are worried about your health in the long term the best thing you can do is get vaccinated to protect yourself against covid19 while we cant necessarily predict the future we can weigh up the available evidence to make the best decision to look after ourselves and our loved ones																
188	1	Scicheck digest the pfizer/biontech covid19 vaccine showed a final efficacy of 91% against symptomatic illness in its phase 3 trial social media posts wrongly claim recently released pfizer documents show the vaccine is 12% effective that appears to be a misreading of data released more than a year ago full story the pfizer/biontech covid19 vaccine was the first to be granted emergency use authorization by the food and drug administration on dec 11 2020 the eua was based on the interim results from the phase 3 randomized controlled trial involving 36523 participants  about half receiving the vaccine and the other half getting a placebo  showing the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing covid19 disease among these clinical trial participants with eight covid19 cases in the vaccine group and 162 in the placebo group the fda said at the time months later on aug 23 2021 the vaccine received full fda approval after a review of the manufacturing process ongoing results from the clinical trial and safety monitoring at that point the fda reviewed updated trial results on about 20000 vaccine and 20000 placebo recipients showing the vaccine was 91% effective in preventing symptomatic covid19 yet various social media posts in may have claimed that just released pfizer documents show the vaccine is 12% effective that appears to be a misunderstanding of the pfizer fda briefing document released in december 2020 before the eua was granted hundreds of thousands of pages of pfizer documents on its vaccine trial have been released as part of a freedom of information act request but two experts who have looked into the 12% claim  a biostatistician and an epidemiologist  have said those foia documents dont appear to be the source of the claim some background on the foia release a group called public health and medical professionals for transparency asked the fda for the more than 300000 pages of documents related to the pfizer vaccine four days after the agency gave the shot its full approval the fda argued that releasing 500 pages a month was the standard rate and that staffers would need to go through all of the documents to redact some information before releasing them in early january a judge in north texas set a deadline of jan 31 for the first batch to be released with 55000 pages every month to follow at that pace all of the documents will be public by the end of the summer the documents have been subject to other false claims as weve written before but with the efficacy claim jeffrey s morris director of the division of biostatistics in the department of biostatistics epidemiology and informatics at the university of pennsylvania perelman school of medicine and gideon meyerowitzkatz an epidemiologist working on his phd at the university of wollongong in australia found it likely came from a misreading of documents that were made public more than a year ago the december 2020 pfizer/biontech fda briefing document for the vaccines and related biological products advisory committee meeting the committee which reviews data on safety and efficacy of vaccines and then makes a recommendation to the fda met on dec 10 2020 to discuss the emergency use authorization for the pfizer/biontech covid19 vaccine the briefing document and other materials were posted online before that meeting the committee recommended that the fda grant that authorization which the fda did the next day fda briefing document on may 5 morris wrote on his website that the claim about 12% efficacy likely came from an april 3 post on substack as best he could determine that post claimed to find [d]amning results buried in the fda briefing document but the authors claim of a possible vaccine efficacy this low is an erroneous one morris wrote meyerowitzkatz also examined the claim finding that it is completely and utterly false and based on a very simple misreading of the documents the author of the substack post dismisses the vaccine efficacy of 95% in the fda briefing document  which as we said above was based on 162 confirmed cases in the placebo group and eight in the vaccine group  and instead points to data on suspected but unconfirmed covid19 cases those totaled 1594 in the vaccine group and 1816 in the placebo which would work out to a 12% efficacy figure except these were individuals who had at least one of a number of symptoms and subsequently tested negative on a sarscov2 pcr test the fda briefing document mentions these suspected cases of symptomatic covid19 that were not pcrconfirmed and refers to the protocol which is another pfizer document that describes in detail the clinical protocol for the trial its also available online morris explained that the phrase suspected but unconfirmed isnt in the protocol but the implication is clear suspected is used in the protocol in explaining when an unplanned pcr test should be given to a trial participant due to reported symptoms as described in section 813 page 93/146 of the protocol morris wrote they did this by instructing subjects to immediately contact the site to set up an unplanned potential covidillness visit ideally within 3 days if they experienced any of the following symptoms anew that could indicate potential covid19 fever cough shortness of breath chills muscle pain sore throat loss of taste/smell diarrhea and vomiting anyone reporting one of these symptoms is a suspected covid19 case who is to report for an unplanned clinical visit to determine whether it meets the covid19 case definition or not and that visit would include a pcr test if the test is positive they are a confirmed covid19 case and by context it is clear that the others are suspected but unconfirmed morris said noting that those symptoms of course could come from many causes not just covid19 infections meyerowitzkatz wrote of the suspected but unconfirmed phrase what this actually means is that these people did not have a covid19 infection to assume they did would be to assume an incredibly high falsenegative rate for the pcr tests of more than 95% morris said but the data show these tests are highly accurate the pcr test used in the trial showed a 4% falsenegative rate in this fda document morris pointed out we asked pfizer about these claims and the press office told us of the released documents all information is reviewed meticulously by experienced medical and clinical experts who are equipped in interpreting the data in the context of the full package submitted nonexperts reviewing such scientific data is likely to lead to information being misinterpreted or taken out of context regulatory authorities around the world have authorized the pfizerbiontech covid19 vaccine and expert medical committees have and continue to review the data and recommended it more than 126 million people in the us have been fully vaccinated with the pfizer/biontech vaccine and it has continued to show strong effectiveness in realworld conditions as found by various studies from around the world for instance a study published in the new england journal of medicine in july 2021 found the vaccine was 88% effective in preventing symptomatic disease in the uk against the delta variant and it still has performed well in preventing severe disease during the omicron wave even as effectiveness against symptomatic illness waned a centers for disease control and prevention study found that adults who had received two doses of either the pfizer/biontech or moderna vaccine had a 79% lower risk of dying or needing a ventilator if hospitalized with covid19 compared with unvaccinated adults during the omicron wave the risk was 94% lower for those who also had received a booster vaccine dose editors note scichecks

189	1	Vaccine experts weigh in on side effects efficacy rates and how the vaccines stack up against the variants new section new section editors note this article was written before the centers for disease control and prevention called for a pause on the use of the johnson & johnson covid19 vaccine on april 13 the pause was recommended to allow for further investigation into a rare but serious blood clotting condition that occurred in six women after they received the vaccine on april 23 cdc advisers recommended that use of the j&j vaccine restart with a label stating the risk of the condition ninety percent of adults in america will be eligible for a covid19 vaccine by april 19 according to the white house this means that millions of people will have the chance to line up for their shot in less than three weeks but what remains to be seen is how many eligible people will take that chance a pew research center survey in late february found that 69% of americans either have already been vaccinated or plan to be vaccinated thats up from the 60% who said theyd get vaccinated last november still 30% of respondents said they would probably or definitely not get a vaccine the top reasons given for foregoing it were concerns about how well the vaccines work their side effects and distrust in the quick development process aamcnews spoke with vaccine experts to answer common questions about the covid19 vaccines how do the vaccines work the united states has authorized three vaccines for emergency use and a fourth is likely to go before the food and drug administration for approval in the coming weeks pfizer and moderna the first two covid19 vaccines to be greenlit in the united states use messenger rna (mrna) which is a molecule that instructs human cells to make a piece of the spike protein that the coronavirus uses to attach to and infect human cells the material from the vaccine quickly disintegrates and never enters the cells nucleus so it cant alter the recipients dna the presence of the harmless spike proteins triggers the immune system to create antibodies and activate tcells that mount an immune response with the immune system primed it is ready to act quickly if it ever detects the coronavirus in the body researchers have been working on mrna technology since the 1990s to fight a variety of diseases from influenza to ebola but the covid19 vaccine is the first time this technology has been authorized for the public the pfizer vaccine requires two doses administered 21 days apart and the moderna vaccine requires two doses 28 days apart johnson & johnson the third vaccine to receive emergency use approval in the united states uses another relatively new vaccine technology that tweaks a harmless adenovirus  a type of virus that causes a common cold  to deliver the coronavirus spike protein instructions after decades of research the first adenovirus vaccine  used to protect against the ebola virus  was approved in july 2020 scientists reengineered the adenovirus in the covid19 vaccine so that it cannot replicate and make the recipient sick but it can still deliver the spike protein instructions its kind of like hijacking a known virus says wilbur chen md an infectious disease and vaccine expert and chief of the adult clinical studies section of the center for vaccine development and global health within the university of maryland school of medicine the johnson & johnson vaccine requires only one dose (the cdc called for a pause using this vaccine on april 13 in order to further investigate its safety after a rare but serious blood clotting condition that occurred in six women after vaccination) astrazeneca this vaccine is not yet approved in the united states but its manufacturers plan to seek approval in the coming weeks it works in a similar way to the johnson & johnson vaccine except it uses a reengineered adenovirus that typically infects chimpanzees the astrazeneca vaccine currently requires two doses given four weeks apart but there is some uncertainty about how far apart the doses can be administered the united kingdom delayed the second shot to 12 weeks and one study suggests that the longer delay may have strengthened the vaccines effectiveness which vaccine is the best one the experts agreed the best vaccine is the one that is first available to you what i tell my patients and family members is to take whatever vaccine you can get says mark mulligan md a professor at nyu grossman school of medicine and director of the nyu langone vaccine center who led the clinical trials for the astrazeneca and pfizer vaccines at new york university (nyu) theyre all highly effective you cant really make any discernment from one to another some have speculated that the pfizer and moderna vaccines  with their roughly 95% efficacy rates in clinical trials  are better than the johnson & johnson vaccine (66% efficacy) and the astrazeneca vaccine (76% efficacy) but comparing the different vaccines efficacy rates is sometimes like comparing apples and oranges according to anna durbin md a professor at johns hopkins university school of medicine and johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health in baltimore who specializes in infectious disease and vaccines what i tell my patients and family members is to take whatever vaccine you can get theyre all highly effective you cant really make any discernment from one to another mark mulligan md professor at nyu grossman school of medicine and director of the nyu langone vaccine center efficacy data depends on many factors including when and where the clinical trials took place she says pfizer and moderna for example tested their vaccines earlier in the pandemic and primarily in the united states before more contagious and deadly variants emerged while much of johnson & johnsons data was gathered in south america and south africa where particularly troubling variants were spreading another complication is what the researchers conducting the clinical trials were measuring the efficacy number reported in clinical trials was against any covid19 symptoms  even mild ones what were trying to do is prevent severe illness durbin explains all of them are close to 100% at preventing hospitalized covid19 in fact experts say that the johnson & johnson vaccine has some advantages over the mrna vaccines including that it does not require ultracold storage and can be given as a onedose regimen the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) says that a person can consider themselves fully vaccinated two weeks after the single shot of johnson & johnson or the second shot of pfizer or moderna if a person has previously been infected with sarscov2 the timeline may be shortened one study at nyu grossman school of medicine found that in the days following the first vaccine dose previously infected people produced similar or greater numbers of antibodies than previously uninfected people did after the second shot mulligan who led the study says that the information could suggest that people who have had covid19 might only need one shot of the mrna vaccines but that requires further study are the vaccines safe every vaccine that is approved in the united states even if under emergency use authorization undergoes stringent safety testing and the cdc continues to collect data on any side effects or adverse outcomes that could be related to the vaccine over time people who receive vaccines may experience a number of side effects such as a sore arm fever fatigue chills nausea and body aches  especially after the second dose of one of the twodose regimens this is a sign that the immune system is reacting and is not a cause for concern the cdc recommends taking a painkiller after (not before) getting the shot and exercising the arm to avoid soreness the side effects are generally more intense after the second shot as the immune system reacts to the known spike protein the cdc also reports that 80% of those who reported experiencing side effects were women which may be related to sex hormones role in the immune response according to a new york times article there are some rare serious side effects such as anaphylaxis  a lifethreatening but treatable allergic reaction in the united states this reaction has occurred in about two to five people per million vaccinated and has not resulted in any deaths the cdc requires that vaccinated people stay at the vaccination site for observation for at least 15 minutes after getting the shot in case they do have a negative reaction kathryn edwards md a vaccinologist and the sarah h sell and cornelius vanderbilt professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at vanderbilt university school of medicine in nashville tennessee spends most of her day assessing reactions after covid19 vaccines as part of her cdcfunded clinical immunization safety assessment unit her team which is working with allergists believes that someone who has an immediate anaphylactic reaction to the first dose of an mrna vaccine should not receive the second dose of that vaccine but rather may be able to get the johnson & johnson vaccine for their second shot with careful monitoring ive been doing this a long time and i dont know that ive worked any harder than i am now we want to make sure that the public knows that we want these vaccines to be both safe and effective kathryn edwards md vaccinologist and professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at vanderbilt university school of medicine edwards also cautions that not all adverse reactions that happen around the time of vaccination are caused by the vaccine as people with underlying conditions  particularly older individuals  receive a vaccine heart attacks or strokes will happen and could be coincidental her team is working to determine whether certain reactions are happening more often than would be expected after vaccination for example there is a concern that came up with the astrazeneca vaccine that resulted in several countries pausing or limiting its use due to reports of blood clots edwards says that the number of people who have experienced blood clots after being vaccinated in the united states so far is lower than what would be expected in the everyday population still the cdc is continually looking at these rates to identify any signal for a reaction that might be associated with a vaccine though any longterm effects of the vaccines are not yet known edwards says that she and the cdc are being vigilant in investigating any potential problems as they arise ive been doing this a long time she notes and i dont know that ive worked any harder than i am now we want to make sure that the public knows that we want these vaccines to be both safe and effective do the vaccines protect against the variants the optimism that came with the approval of covid19 vaccines in late 2020 was tempered by the emergence of several coronavirus variants that had mutated to be more contagious deadlier and potentially able to evade the vaccines but the data so far suggest that currently available vaccines work well against the variants chen says that those who are vaccinated and later infected with one of the concerning variants are still unlikely to be hospitalized though there is little realworld data on how the vaccines work against the b1351 variant  a particularly concerning one first detected in south africa  one small clinical trial for the astrazeneca vaccine was halted after it showed only 22% efficacy against the variant notably none of the vaccinated people who were generally lowrisk for severe covid19 to begin with were hospitalized or died the world health organization says that the vaccines are likely to provide at least some protection against each of the variants because they prompt a broad immune response beyond just targeting the spike protein that is the focus of the vaccines pfizer and moderna have begun testing third booster shots of the vaccines to see if the extra dose could provide further protection against the variants they are also developing variantspecific vaccines targeting the b1351 variant edwards would not be surprised if it turns out that people need to continue to get covid19 booster shots as additional variants emerge when new strains emerge we may need to make new vaccines we have been doing that for many years [for the flu vaccine] she explains we may need to do it for covid as well but it is still a race between vaccination and variants the key to ending the pandemic is getting vaccines administered to people across the globe as of march 30 there had been only 74 vaccine doses administered per 100 people globally and many lowincome countries had not yet administered a single dose according to the new york times vaccination tracker until the entire world has conquered the virus durbin says were going to have to keep protecting ourselves

refrigeration  women younger than 50 years old should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots after vaccination will i need a booster shot studies show that protection against sarscov2 begins to decrease over time after initial vaccine doses additional vaccine doses (booster vaccinations) provide longerlasting protection against covid19 the fda has authorized booster vaccinations of all three covid19 vaccines available in the united states the eligibility period for a booster dose is based on several factors including which vaccine you originally received and how long it has been since you were fully vaccinated eligible people can choose which vaccine they receive as a booster dose  this is known as heterologous or mix and match dosing based on data from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases the fda has determined that the benefits of mixing doses outweighs any known or potential risks do the vaccines work studies show that covid19 vaccines are very effective in preventing covid19 even for people at high risk for the disease sometimes people who are fully vaccinated get a breakthrough infection meaning that they test positive for sarscov2 or become ill with covid19 fully vaccinated people are less likely to become seriously ill even from covid19 variants how do i know the vaccines are safe vaccines have very high safety standards and covid19 vaccines are no exception covid19 vaccines have undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in us history the timeline for creating covid19 vaccines was shorter than for other vaccines for many reasons including nih scientists have been studying mrna vaccines and coronaviruses for decades they had a head start because they already knew a lot about how mrna vaccines work and how to make them researchers the federal government and drug companies came together like never before to cooperate and share resources making the vaccine testing process more efficient nih set up the covid19 prevention network (covpn) to coordinate existing research networks and carry out large clinical trials in tens of thousands of people efficiently many americans from diverse communities volunteered to participate in the studies the fda analyzed data from the clinical trials right away the safety of the authorized covid19 vaccines is being tracked through the vaccine adverse event reporting system a unique safety system called vsafe that was established specifically for covid19 vaccines and other systems vaccine manufacturers submit monthly safety updates

questions researchers try to answer in each and how a vaccine is developed approved and manufactured do the vaccines protect against virus variants studies and current data show that the antibodies our bodies make after vaccination recognize and protect against covid19 variants this is being closely investigated and more studies are underway the rise of these variants is a reminder that as long as sarscov2 continues to spread it has the potential to evolve into new variants widespread vaccination will help reduce the rise of additional variants can children get  a vaccine children and teens age 5 and older can now get the pfizer covid19 vaccine eligible children age 5 and older can also receive a booster dose of the pfizer vaccine it is currently the only covid19 vaccine authorized for people younger than 18 however clinical trials are underway to test the safety and effectiveness of all currently available vaccines in younger children do the vaccines have any side effects all vaccines may cause some side effects which are normal signs that your body is making antibodies these side effects go away in a few days many people have no side effects serious side effects that could cause longterm health problems are extremely unlikely following any vaccination including covid19 vaccination these rare side effects usually appear within six weeks of receiving a vaccine dose if you have any health problems after vaccination report them to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) rare cases of heart inflammation have been reported after mrna covid19 vaccination

person had covid19 and whether and when they received treatment if you have had covid19 and want to be vaccinated talk to your doctor about when you should get the vaccine are vaccines still being researched new and ongoing studies on vaccines are underway nih institutes and centers in partnership with private businesses continue to study different types of vaccines some current research aims to determine whether approved vaccines will grant immunity against emerging covid19 variants and whether new vaccines will be needed other vaccine studies continue to monitor the health of people who have already had a vaccine to determine their effectiveness over a longer period of time nih has begun a clinical trial to assess the antibody response to an extra dose of an authorized or approved covid19 vaccine in people with autoimmune disease who did not respond to an original covid19 vaccine regimen the trial also will investigate whether pausing immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune

191	1	Abstract this study is aimed to identify the adverse effects associated with three types of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines approximately 1736 individuals agreed to participate in this study the participants involved in the study were individuals who had received the first dose or full course (two doses) of the vaccine at least 30 days before the survey a direct and interactive webbased system interview with a paper and electronic version of the questionnaire was used for all participants a total of 1736 randomized individuals were identified the reactogenicity of the vaccines including pain redness urticaria and swelling at the site of the injection was reported in 3456% of the participants local site reaction was reported in more individuals who had pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines than those who received the sinopharm vaccine the systemic events were more common with astrazeneca and pfizer vaccines symptoms reported were fatigue body pain headache muscle pain fever and gastrointestinal side effects there were no correlations between age or gender and the duration of the adverse effects for the three vaccines swelling and severe allergic reaction of the eyelids severe hypotension generalized body aches shortness of breath weakness and numbness on the injected arm acute hyperglycemia severe chest pain and fever more than 39c were among the unusual signs and symptoms reported by the participants pfizer astrazeneca and sinopharm vaccines were found to be safe and sinopharm vaccine showed a lower prevalence of adverse effects compared with the other vaccines the duration and severity of adverse effects were not affected by age or gender unusual side effects should be closely monitored to establish determine they are linked to the immunization keywords astrazeneca vaccine covid19 pfizer vaccine sinopharm vaccine vaccine go to 1 introduction the united states has approved the use of two coronavirus disease 2019 (covid19) vaccines1 the food and drug administration granted an emergency use authorization for the pfizerbiontech covid19 vaccine on december 11 2020 and on december 18 2020 for the moderna covid19 vaccine both are to be given in a twodose sequence2 according to reuters phase iii trials for the sinopharm shot took place in 10 countries around the world in september 2020 china and some other countries including jordan have approved the sinopharm vaccine3 these vaccines have been modeled in different development approaches therefore they have diversity in some characteristics like efficacy and storage conditions4 the pfizer and moderna vaccines are nucleic acid vaccines that use genetic materials such as messenger rna or mrna a technology that gets part of genetic code into the human cells sinopharm on the other hand is bbibpcorv an inactivated coronavirus vaccine5 the immune response is triggered to produce antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sarscov2) coronavirus by bbibpcorv antibodies bind to viral proteins like the spike proteins that stud the viruss surface safety monitoring for these vaccines is an essential phase iv clinical study despite thousands of participants were involved in the clinical phase ii and iii trials at the time of writing the number of people vaccinated was 41161 million and 93343417 are fully vaccinated globally6 for a good reason vaccine production is a lengthy and timeconsuming process vaccines are typically given to large groups of healthy people to avoid infection rather than to give them to sick people to help them recover therefore a new vaccines protection threshold must be very high and apply to the entire target population regardless of age gender color or ethnicity7 individuals would not consider taking a vaccine because of its side effects when it is meant to protect them from contracting the infection the careful and deliberate method of vaccines production and testing is guided by this central emphasis on protection phase 4 trials which include hundreds of thousands of people and concentrate on vaccines safety (how well the vaccine performs in the real world) as well as monitoring for rare adverse effects are done after the vaccine has been licensed8 there was no evidence of a causal association between covid19 vaccines and death this was based on records collected from death certificates autopsy reports psychiatric history and clinical descriptions from vaers reports and healthcare providers only a few cases of anaphylaxis have been identified after receiving pfizerbiontech and moderna covid19 vaccines (45 reported cases per million doses administered)9 reactions registered to the vsafe system by people who had received the pfizerbiontech vaccine were more common after administering the second dose than after the first the two covid19 vaccines currently in use did not show any signs of unexpected significant adverse effects in their original postauthorization protection profiles10 these findings provide reassurance and insights on what healthcare providers and vaccinated individuals should predict after vaccination go to 2 patients and methods this study involved 1736 participants with the age range of 1886 years the participants included in the study were people who had taken the first dose or full course of vaccine (two doses) a minimum of 30 days before the study moreover participants subgrouped into those who had taken either pfizer astrazeneca or sinopharm vaccine a trained research assistant conducted a direct interview with a paper version of the questionnaire and an interactive webbased system interview with an electronic version of the questionnaire for the participants the questionnaire collected information such as the participants demographic data (age gender weight and smoking) comorbidities (cardiovascular respiratory kidney liver immunological and endocrine diseases) type of vaccine received number of vaccine doses and the symptoms the individuals presented with after the vaccination and the duration of these symptoms the prevalence of these adverse reactions was analyzed and assessed to determine what symptoms are the most common and to what type of vaccine could be associated with 21 statistical analysis statistical analysis and figures were conducted using spss software (version 230 spss) and prism 8 for os x (version 843 graphicpad software llc) the prevalence of signs and symptoms were expressed as a number and percentage and mean  sd was used to describe the continuous variables

object name is jmv99990g004jpg figure 4 hazard ratio associated with the three types of vaccines go to 4 discussion even though the year 2020 had been a tough year for all 58 vaccines against the sarscov2 have been developed and are in clinical trials 1 with some vaccines currently achieving over 90% effectiveness against covid19 in clinical trials11 this extraordinary accomplishment comes at a time when covid19 events are at an alltime peak on a regular basis around the world the development of coronavirus vaccines happened in a short period when it is essential for the regulatory and medical decisions to focus on benefit and risk estimates identifying the stakes and possible checkpoints12 delivering a conformationally accurate protein is crucial for any vaccine that aims to induce antibodymediated immunity the safety of vaccinations provided to otherwise healthy people is a top priority and theres a possibility that vaccination could make sarscov2 infection worse13 identifying quantifying and weighing proven and possible safety risks against potential advantages are important aspects of designing any vaccine14 one of the concerns posed during the production of the covid19 vaccine was whether the immune responses evidenced by the vaccine will help or prejudice sarscov2 transmission as infection could happen after vaccination15 side effects are natural reactions to foreign drug injection these include symptoms such as fever muscle pain and inflammation at the site of injection they are mediated by the innate immune system when the bodys neutrophils or macrophages detect vaccine molecules they release cytokines which are chemical signals that trigger immune responses expressed as fever chills nausea and muscle pain this cytokines reaction is expected to occur when a foreign agent is inserted into the bloodstream16 about half of people aged 1655 who got a sarscov2 vaccine experienced a headache after the second dose according to trials when neither the recipients nor the researchers had the knowledge of who got a placebo and who got the mrna vaccine this reaction may relate to the vaccine17 blood clots which lead the united states to halt the astrazeneca vaccine are a very unusual occurrence reportedly occurring one in a million times blood clots are currently being investigated as a possible side effect of the vaccine yet a link to be found they will be an incredibly unlikely complication18 according to scientists there is no connection between the initial inflammatory reaction and the longterm defensive response there is no scientific indication that those with more noticeable vaccine side effects are better protected from covid19 theres no reason to think that an exaggerated innate response will help the adaptive response19 this study was not designed to assess the efficacy of these vaccines the study focused primarily on reporting the postvaccination signs and symptoms expressed by the participants and comparing them between the three vaccines overall the three types of vaccines were found to be safe a direct conclusion according to the severity of the side effects the individuals experienced postvaccination when the signs and symptoms were mild or moderate the postauthorization safety profiles for pfizer biontech and sinopharm covid19 vaccines are reassuring after the administration of 1736 doses to the public within the first month of the vaccination program following the initiation of these vaccinations reports of anaphylaxis have been submitted during the analytic era the incidence of anaphylaxis after receiving covid19 vaccines was within the range for the data recorded after receiving inactivated influenza vaccine pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine successful medications for anaphylaxis are available9 reactogenicity was generally mild or moderate and reactions were less common and milder in participants who had sinopharm vaccine compared to pfizer and astrazeneca vaccine in a doubleblind randomized placebocontrolled clinical trial performed in henan province china the average cumulative adverse events recorded after 7 days of sinopharm vaccine for phases 1 and 2 were 15%20 in our study overall sinopharm vaccinations adverse effect was ranged between 118% with loss of smell and test to 2706% with a headache fatigue headache body pain and muscle pain were among the most common adverse effects associated with the three vaccines astrazeneca was associated with higher prevalence this is compatible with other studies one of the study limitations was the number of participants who administered the second dose of vaccine generally the first dose of the vaccine showed a higher prevalence of adverse effects with astrazeneca vaccine followed by pfizer and was less with sinopharm despite a small number of participants received the second dose of astrazeneca vaccine the adverse effect was still higher compared with the other two vaccines though fatigue body pain and reactogenicity were higher prevalent after the second dose of pfizer vaccine this however requires further investigation with largescale participants although age was not significantly shown to affecting the duration and severity of the adverse effect of the three types of vaccines the duration was longer in participants over 55 years old who received astrazeneca and sinopharm vaccine with regards to the pfizer vaccine the duration was relatively higher in participants aged between 36 and 55 this conclusion could be resulted from the small number of elderly participants recruited for the study who administered pfizer vaccine furthermore females suffered from adverse effects with longer duration compared to male counterparts after receiving one of the three vaccines in this study we reported unusual events that could be related to the vaccines like swelling and severe allergic reaction of eyelids hospital admission due to positive results for covid19 infection weakness and numbness of the hand of the injected arm severe chest pain nasal bleeding acute hypertension with blood pressure over 210/105 mm hg and acute hyperglycemia (fbs > 170 mg/dl) these events were most evident with pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines and only one case was reported with sinopharm vaccine since untoward cases might occur independently of vaccination we must closely review any case of adverse effect after vaccination paying particular attention to the base incidence of that event in the community before vaccination go to 5 conclusion pfizer astrazeneca and sinopharm vaccines were found to be safe according to the observation of the mild to moderate postvaccination signs and symptoms sinopharm vaccine showed a lower prevalence of adverse effects compared with pfizer and astrazeneca vaccine after first and second dose respectively age and gender were not significantly affecting the duration and severity of adverse effects unusual adverse effects should be monitored carefully to determine whether they are related to the vaccine or not go to conflict of interests the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests go to ethics statement all participants enrolled in the study signed their written consent forms before participating in the study and give an agreement to use their results the study was

192	1	How do we know covid vaccines are safe by michelle roberts health editor bbc news online published15 february share related topics coronavirus pandemic doctor administering injection to young woman image sourcegetty images more than 60% of the worlds population  48 billion people  have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine there are different approved types and brands available and all have undergone rigorous testing and safety checks how do we know a vaccine is safe safety trials begin in the lab with tests and research on cells and animals before moving on to human studies the principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns when will i get a coronavirus vaccine what role do trials have if the safety data from the labs is good scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective that means tests on large numbers of volunteers  about 40000 in the case of pfizerbiontech the first to be approved in the uk half are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab the researchers and participants are not told which group is which until after the results to avoid bias media caption bbcs laura foster explains the order in which the covid vaccine will be given all of the work and findings are checked and verified independently the covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed but they didnt skip any steps  they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside who approves vaccines or treatments approval is only given if regulators are happy that a vaccine is safe and effective checks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or longterm risks in the uk independent experts on the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it after approval by the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency what is the fasttrack approval for vaccines against new variants scientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge the uks drug regulator says new vaccines can be fasttracked for approval if needed no corners will be cut with safety paramount but lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed instead data from existing studies and ongoing realworld use could be used whats in the covid vaccines pfizerbiontechs vaccine (and modernas) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response these are called mrna vaccines they do not alter human cells but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to covid the oxfordastrazeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients like aluminium that make the vaccine stable or more effective will the vaccine give me side effects vaccines do not give you a disease instead they teach your bodys immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against some people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated this is not the disease itself but the bodys response to the vaccine common reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills tiredness and aching muscles what about serious reactions it is rare to find that health problems occurring following a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself events may be coincidental and unrelated to vaccination the oxfordastrazeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots this is not proof that the vaccine is to blame covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too the chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low but as a precaution younger age groups in the uk have been offered alternative covid vaccines what about allergies allergic reactions to vaccines are rare for any approved vaccine the ingredients are listed there have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the pfizerbiontech vaccine as a precaution the mhra says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab be aware that antivaccine stories are spread online through social media these posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation) how the vaccines compare what if ive already had covid people will still be offered the jab even if they have had covid in the past thats because natural immunity may not be longlived and immunisation could offer more protection guidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with long covid either but people who are currently unwell with covid19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered how animalfriendly are vaccines and do they contain alcohol some vaccines such as the shingles vaccine and the childrens nasal flu vaccine can contain pork gelatine the covid vaccines from pfizer moderna and astrazeneca do not contain this or any other animal products the british islamic medical association says there is negligible alcohol in it  no more than in bread for example																
193	1	Safety of covid19 vaccines 31 march 2021   francais  espanol portugues this article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution learn more about vaccines  from how they work and how theyre made to ensuring safety and equitable access  in whos vaccines explained series countries around the world are rolling out covid19 vaccines and a key topic of interest is their safety vaccine safety is one of whos highest priorities and were working closely with national authorities to develop and implement standards to ensure that covid19 vaccines are safe and effective ensuring safety billions of people have been safely vaccinated against covid19 all of the approved covid19 vaccines have been carefully tested and continue to be monitored like all vaccines covid19 vaccines go through a rigorous multistage testing process including large clinical trials that involve tens of thousands of people these trials are specifically designed to identify any safety concerns an external panel of experts convened by who analyses the results from clinical trials and recommends whether and how the vaccines should be used officials in individual countries decide whether to approve the vaccines for national use and develop policies for how to use the vaccines based on who recommendations after a covid19 vaccine is introduced who supports work with vaccine manufacturers health officials in each country and other partners to monitor for any safety concerns on an ongoing basis new vaccine technology some covid19 vaccines have been developed with an approach that uses messenger rna (mrna) the mrna vaccine technology has been studied for over a decade including in the development of vaccines for zika rabies and influenza these mrna vaccines have been rigorously assessed for safety and clinical trials have shown that they provide a longlasting immune response mrna vaccines are not live virus vaccines and do not interfere with human dna for more information on mrna vaccines see whos explainer on the different types of covid19 vaccines safety of covid19 vaccines for different groups covid19 vaccines have been tested in large randomized controlled trials that include people of a broad age range all sexes different ethnicities and those with known medical conditions the vaccines have shown a high level of efficacy across all populations vaccines have been found to be safe and effective in people with various underlying medical conditions that are associated with increased risk of severe disease these include high blood pressure diabetes asthma pulmonary liver or kidney disease and chronic infections that are stable and controlled those who should consult with a doctor before vaccination include people with a compromised immune system older people with severe frailty people with a history of severe allergic reaction to vaccines people living with hiv and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding for more information about vaccine safety for different groups please see our q&a on covid19 vaccine safety pregnancy you can get vaccinated whilst you are pregnant during pregnancy you are at higher risk of serious illness caused by covid19 you are also at higher risk of delivering your baby prematurely if you contract covid19 while there is less data available on vaccination of pregnant people evidence on the safety of covid19 vaccines during pregnancy has been growing and no safety concerns have been identified especially in countries with high transmission or if you have an occupation where you are at more risk of being exposed to covid19 the benefits of getting the vaccine outweigh potential risks there is no risk of getting covid19 from the vaccine talk to your healthcare provider to make an informed decision about vaccination questions and answers covid19 vaccines and pregnancy breastfeeding if you are breastfeeding you should get vaccinated against covid19 as soon as it is your turn none of the current covid19 vaccines have live virus in them this means there is no risk of you transmitting covid19 to your baby through your breastmilk from the vaccine in fact the antibodies you get after vaccination may go through your breast milk and help to protect your baby safety of covid19 vaccines for children the pfizer vaccine is safe for use in children aged 5 years and above for children in this age group who recommends a reduced dosage of 10 g (02 ml) both pfizer and moderna are safe for use in children aged 12 and above using a dose of 03 ml and 05 ml respectively however while the availability of covid19 vaccines is limited who recommends that countries should vaccinate children only when high vaccine coverage with two doses has been achieved in higher priorityuse groups as identified in the who prioritization roadmap however children with existing health conditions should be prioritised for vaccination at the same time as other high risk groups vaccine trials to determine whether other covid19 vaccines are safe for use in children are ongoing and who recommendations will be updated when the evidence supports a change in the policy practicing the protective behaviours is still the best way to keep everyone including children safe from covid19 whether or not you have been vaccinated keep a safe distance from others avoid crowds wear a wellfitting mask covering your mouth and nose keep indoor spaces well ventilated clean hands regularly and cover coughs and sneezes as well as getting vaccinated as soon as its your turn

more hms news here now a study published aug 25 in the new england journal of medicine by researchers from clalit research institute in israel harvard medical school and the harvard th chan school of public health answers that question the research which assessed the safety of the pfizer/biontech bnt162b2 mrna vaccine is based on analysis of data from nearly 2 million individuals in israel and represents one of the largest realworld assessments of covid19 vaccine safety to date the findings the researchers said affirm the overall safety of the vaccine and underscore that the risk of adverse consequences from actual infection with sarscov2 far outweighs potential vaccine risks related stories the present and future of covid variants experts stress testing vaccination amid delta surge

broadly protective covid19 vaccine boosters antibodies attacking coronavirus the study involved two analyses a comparison of adverse events between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals and between unvaccinated people infected with sarscov2 and unvaccinated noninfected people the study showed that few adverse events were associated with the vaccine myocarditis or inflammation of the heart muscle the most serious of them was rare with a rate of 27 excess cases per 100000 vaccinated people this means that for every 100000 individuals 27 more cases of myocarditis occurred than would be expected the researchers said by contrast the risk of myocarditis was notably higher among infected but unvaccinated individuals occurring at a rate of 11 excess cases per 100000 people coronavirus infectionbut not vaccinationwas also associated with greatly increased risk of pericarditis (an inflammation of the area around the heart) heart arrhythmias heart attacks strokes pulmonary embolism deepvein thrombosis acute kidney damage among others vaccine hesitancy to date one of the main drivers of vaccine hesitancy has been a lack of information regarding potential side effects of the vaccine said study coauthor ben reis hms assistant professor of pediatrics at boston childrens hospital and director of the predictive medicine group in the computational health informatics program at boston childrens this careful epidemiological study provides reliable information on vaccine safety which we hope will be helpful to those who have not yet decided about vaccination reis said those who have hesitated until now to get vaccinated due to concerns about very rare side effects such as myocarditis should be aware that the risks for this very same side effect are actually higher among unvaccinated infected individuals reis said the results are based on records from clalit health services in israel one of the worlds largest integrated health record databases the analysis is the largest peerreviewed evaluation of the safety of a covid19 vaccine in a nationwide massvaccination setting the extensive nationwide rollout of israels covid19 vaccination campaign provided the clalit research institute with a unique opportunity to assess through its rich and comprehensive digital datasets the safety of the vaccine in a realworld setting without needing to rely on individualdriven active reporting of side effects said study senior author ran balicer director of the clalit research institute and chief innovation officer for clalit these results show convincingly that this mrna vaccine is very safe and that the alternative of natural morbidity caused by the coronavirus puts a person at significant higher and much more common risk of serious adverse events balicer said the results of this realworld study confirm complement and build on the previously reported findings of the pfizer/biontech phase 3 randomized clinical trial which involved 21720 individuals the researchers noted the comprehensive nature of this new analysis and the sheer volume of data involved offer a more detailed assessment of the vaccines safety across a wider range of adverse events these data should facilitate informed individual riskbenefit decisionmaking and in our view make a strong argument in favor of opting in to get vaccinated especially in countries where the virus is currently widespread added balicer who also serves as chairman of israels national expert advisory team on covid19 response previous efforts to characterize vaccine safety have relied on voluntary active reporting by vaccinated individuals known to be incomplete the new study relies on the analysis of millions of anonymized electronic medical records which are far more comprehensive parallel analyses in an effort to provide the proper context that is critical for interpreting vaccine safety findings the researchers also examine a wide range of adverse events both among vaccinated individuals and among unvaccinated individuals who were infected with the coronavirus conducting two parallel analyses assessing the occurrence of 25 adverse events in each of these groups in the vaccinated subgroup the researchers compared the outcomes of 884828 vaccinated individuals 16 years and older with those of 884828 unvaccinated individuals based on an extensive set of sociodemographic geographic and healthrelated characteristics this analysis took place from dec 20 2020 the launch of israels national vaccination campaign through may 24 2021 some individuals switched groups based on their changing vaccination status with 235541 people moving from the unvaccinated group into the vaccinated group during the study to provide context for the vaccine safety findings above a separate analysis was conducted among unvaccinated individuals this analysis estimated rates of the same 25 potential adverse events among 173106 unvaccinated individuals who were infected with sarscov2 compared with 173106 carefully matched controls not infected with sarscov2 this analysis took place from march 1 2020 the beginning of the covid19 pandemic in israel through may 24 2021 the vaccine was found to be safe out of 25 potential side effects examined four were found to have a link with the vaccine myocarditis an inflammation of the heart muscle associated with the vaccine was rare27 excess cases per 100000 vaccinated individuals these events were observed mainly among males between the ages of 20 and 34 in contrast myocarditis was far more common among unvaccinated individuals infected with sarscov2 the analysis showed 11 excess cases of myocarditis per 100000 infected individuals other adverse events moderately associated with vaccination were swelling of the lymph nodes a mild side effect that is part of a standard immune response to vaccination with 78 excess cases per 100000 appendicitis with 5 excess cases per 100000 likely as a result of swelling of lymph nodes around the appendix reactivation of dormant herpes zoster (chickenpox virus) infection occurred in 16 cases per 100000 unvaccinated risks these small numbers of adverse events among vaccinated individuals stood in stark contrast with the high rate of multiple and more serious adverse events among unvaccinated individuals infected with sarscov2 these included cardiac arrhythmias (a 38fold increase above baseline risk with 166 cases per 100000 infected patients) kidney damage (148fold increase with 125 excess cases per 100000) pericarditis (54fold increase with 11

195	1	Vaccination is a valuable tool for preventing many different types of infectious diseases when youve been vaccinated against a specific disease you can gain protection  or immunity  against it the food and drug administration (fda) in the united states has to date given emergency use authorization to two vaccines against the virus that causes covid19 these vaccines are the pfizerbiontech and moderna vaccines johnson & johnson has also applied for emergency use authorization by the fda for their singledose vaccine the covid19 vaccine is a vital tool in the effort to stop the spread of the new coronavirus known as sarscov2 but you may be wondering about the safety of the vaccine as well as its potential short and longterm side effects in this article well dig into whats known about the safety of the covid19 vaccine the possible side effects and how the vaccine works to protect you from becoming ill how were the covid19 vaccines able to be developed so fast vaccine development typically takes many years however covid19 vaccines have been developed in a short amount of time in fact according to the world health organization (who)trusted source there are over 200 potential covid19 vaccines in development as of december 2020 at least 52 of these have entered clinical trials in humans how were these able to be developed so quickly below well take a look at how this was achieved scientific collaboration as soon as the new coronavirus was identified and its genetic material was sequenced scientists around the world began studying it in earnest along the way they shared important research results with other scientists this high level of cooperation helped to better distribute valuable knowledge throughout the scientific and medical community about the virus itself how it causes illness and potential vaccination and treatment methods existing research the technology that went into the covid19 vaccine may seem new however its actually been around for some time scientists have been studying new ways to make vaccines for many years now this includes mrna vaccines like those made by pfizerbiontech and moderna in fact prior to the pandemic scientists had been studying this method as a way to make vaccines for other viruses this existing research gave scientists an important head start for developing vaccines for sarscov2 funding vaccine development is very costly one of the main reasons for this is that it requires an abundance of testing for both effectiveness and safety when a vaccine enters human clinical trials these costs begin to expand rapidly three different phases of clinical trials must show safety and effectiveness before a vaccine can be authorized or approved as these trials progress the number of participants grows and so do the costs early in the pandemic funding was poured into the development of covid19 vaccines this funding which came from both public and private sources allowed companies to effectively conduct the necessary vaccine research and clinical trials timeline acceleration normally the stages of vaccine development and testing occur one after the other for example a phase 2 clinical trial would only proceed after a phase 1 trial had been completed this can take a lot of time during the pandemic some of these timelines were accelerated in order to shorten development time additionally companies scaled up the manufacturing of their vaccines while they performed clinical trials this is a large financial risk for these companies as data could show that their vaccine isnt effective or safe leading them to scrap the vaccine altogether however if the vaccine is found to be safe and effective a ready supply of doses is on hand as was the case for the current vaccines what hasnt changed is the fact that all covid19 vaccines still need to undergo rigorous testing protocols aimed at determining their effectiveness and safety although development is sped up accelerated timelines dont compromise scientific standards or integrity companies must still present solid data from human clinical trials to the fda that shows a vaccine is both safe and effective additionally vaccine safety continues to be monitored after authorization or approval what exactly is an emergency use authorization both the pfizerbiontechtrusted source and modernatrusted source vaccines are currently authorized by the fda under an emergency use authorization (eua) this is different from an fda approval eua is a way for the fda to allow unapproved medical products to be used during a public health emergency such as a pandemic in reviewing for eua the fda must determine that the benefits of a product outweigh its potential risks when a company submits for eua for a covid19 vaccine the fda expects to see safety and effectiveness data from a phase 3 clinical trial the trial can still be in progress as long as it has met specific milestones determined by the fda once received fda scientists as well as an external advisory panel made up of scientists and public health experts will carefully go over the data the fda will take both the internal and advisory panel reviews into consideration when deciding to grant an eua whats known about the shortterm effects of the vaccine the shortterm side effects of the authorized covid19 vaccines are similar the side effects typically start within a day or two of getting the vaccine and may include pain redness or swelling at the injection site fatigue fever chills headache body aches and pains nausea swollen lymph nodes its pretty normal to feel mild symptoms like those described above after getting a vaccine although it can be unpleasant its actually a good sign it means that your body is in the process of generating an immune response while these side effects can be unpleasant theyre typically mild or moderate and go away after a few days side effects that are felt throughout your body such as fatigue and fever are more common after getting the second dose serious shortterm side effects although rare some people have experienced more serious shortterm side effects after getting a covid19 vaccine these side effects include immediate allergic reactions and a severe type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis immediate allergic reactions typically occur within 4 hours of receiving the vaccine and can include symptoms like hives wheezing swelling anaphylaxis typically happens shortly after receiving the vaccine symptoms to look out for include hives swelling trouble breathing tightening of the throat feeling dizzy or faint abdominal pain nausea or vomiting diarrhea a rapid heartbeat low blood pressure (hypotension) a feeling of doom after getting the covid19 vaccine you will likely be monitored for at least 15 minutes afterwards to make sure you dont develop any serious side effects healthline resources until you get through this count on our support in difficult times you need to be able to turn to experts who understand and can help strengthen your mental wellbeing were here for you whats known about the longterm effects of the vaccine because the covid19 vaccines have only been administered in the united states since december 2020 the longterm effects are unknown at this time even though people have begun to receive these vaccines studies will continue to evaluate their safety and effectiveness long into the future these studies will also focus on how long the immunity lasts from the vaccines can you get covid19 from the vaccine you cannot get covid19 from the vaccine neither the pfizerbiontech nor the moderna vaccine contain the live virus because of this it cannot cause you to become ill with covid19 both vaccines use mrna technology to generate an immune response to sarscov2 what exactly is mrna both the pfizerbiontech and moderna vaccines consist of a piece of genetic material called mrna simply put mrna provides the cells of your body with instructions on how to make proteins in fact mrna occurs naturally in your body your cells use mrna all the time to produce many types of proteins that are necessary for your health and wellbeing the mrna in the covid19 vaccine contains instructions for making a viral protein called the spike protein this is a protein thats found on the surface of the novel coronavirus the virus uses it to attach to and enter a host cell in your body when you receive the vaccine your body will recognize the spike protein as an invader because of this it will produce antibodies to protect you against the coronaviruss spike protein what happens when the vaccine is injected after you receive your pfizerbiontech or moderna vaccine the mrna can enter the cells in your body these cells begin to produce the spike protein displaying it on their surface cells from your immune system will notice these spike proteins and recognize them as foreign because of this your immune system will begin building an immune response to the spike protein which includes the production of antibodies if the antibodies produced by your immune system then come across the actual sarscov2 virus theyll recognize it as an invader and will be able to destroy it before it causes you to become ill in other words your immune system will be primed and ready to fight off and neutralize the actual virus once you get the vaccine its important to remember that it typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for your body to build up immunity because of this you could be exposed to sarscov2 right before or right after getting the vaccine and still become sick effectiveness its also important to remember that no vaccine is 100 percent effective the pfizerbiontech vaccine is 95 percent effective 7 days after the second dose the moderna vaccine is 941 percent effective 14 days after the second dose after vaccination its important to continue practicing precautions such as mask wearing physical distancing and handwashing can the vaccine change your dna you may have heard concerns about the covid19 vaccine affecting your dna this isnt possible your dna is contained within a special part of your cells called the nucleus the nucleus is separated from other areas of the cell the mrna that your cells naturally produce every day is made within the nucleus but is promptly transported outside of the nucleus to be translated into protein after the protein is made the mrna is destroyed likewise the mrna from the covid19 vaccine will remain outside of the nucleus it will also be destroyed after the spike protein has been made who should avoid getting the vaccine some people should avoid getting the pfizerbiontech or moderna covid19 vaccines this includes anyone whos had either a prior severe or immediate allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in the vaccine either a severe or immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of the vaccine a previous allergic reaction to polyethylene glycol (peg) or polysorbate if youre concerned about the ingredients in the covid19 vaccine both pfizerbiontechtrusted source and modernatrusted source provide full ingredient lists on their fact sheets for recipients and caregivers can children get the vaccine the pfizerbiontech and moderna vaccines are currently only authorized for use in people 16 and older and 18 and older respectively more clinical trials are beginning or are planned for younger children should people with underlying health conditions get the vaccine if you have underlying health conditions you can get the vaccine in fact this is particularly important because some health conditions can put you at a higher risk of serious covid19 complications currently the only exception to this is if youve had a serious or immediate allergic reaction to one or more ingredients in the vaccine in this case you should avoid getting the vaccine if you have an underlying health condition and have questions about receiving the vaccine be sure to speak with your healthcare provider should you get the vaccine if youre pregnant or breastfeeding you can receive the vaccine if youre pregnant or breastfeeding if you have questions or concerns about getting the vaccine talk with your healthcare provider should you still get the vaccine if youve had covid19 and is it safe you may be wondering if you still need to get the vaccine if youve already had covid19 the answer to this question is yes scientists currently dont know how long natural immunity lasts after having covid19 research on this topic is ongoing a 2021 studytrusted source of 188 people who had recovered from covid19 found markers of immunity up to 8 months after infection instances of repeat infection have so far only been documented in casetrusted source studiestrusted source however this does mean that its possible to contract the virus and become ill a second time vaccination can help prevent this from happening currently the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc)trusted source recommends that certain people whove had covid19 wait 90 days before getting the vaccine this includes those that were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma do you still need to take precautions after getting the vaccine if youve already received the covid19 vaccine youll still need to take precautions such as wearing a mask when around others outside of your household practicing physical distancing frequent handwashing avoiding crowded areas or indoor spaces that are poorly ventilated these precautions are necessary because scientists dont yet know if you can still transmit the virus to others after youve been vaccinated its possible that this could happen if youre exposed to the virus following vaccination even if you dont actually become sick or have any typical symptoms of covid19 using vsafe after vaccination vsafe is a tool thats been developed by the cdc it uses text messages and web surveys sent to your phone to help you check in after receiving the covid19 vaccine you can use vsafe to let the cdc know about any side effects you may be experiencing based off of your survey answers someone from the cdc may contact you to discuss your responses in more detail vsafe can also help remind you of when youll need to receive your second dose of the vaccine however it doesnt schedule vaccination appointments so youll still have to do that on your own if youre interested in using vsafe after getting the covid19 vaccine the cdc has instructions for how to registertrusted source the bottom line the covid19 vaccine has been developed in a shorter time frame than most vaccines this was possible due to many factors including unprecedented scientific collaboration a large body of previous research increased funding and accelerated timelines despite the quick development of the vaccine no corners were cut with regard to the science the current vaccines were still tested rigorously in human clinical trials in order to assess their safety and effectiveness the most common shortterm side effects include discomfort at the injection site and mild flulike symptoms allergic reactions to the vaccine can happen but are rare the potential longterm effects of the vaccine are currently unknown receiving the covid19 vaccine is important for preventing illness and stopping the spread of covid19 if you have questions or concerns about the vaccine talk with your doctor

198	1	If youre pregnant you may be wondering whether you should get one of the covid19 vaccines is it safe for you and your unborn child for you to get one of the vaccines the answer is yes according to the nations leading public health experts ready to schedule your vaccine learn more the american college of obstetrician gynecologists (acog) the society for maternal fetal medicine (smfm) the american academy of pediatrics (aap) and the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) strongly recommend vaccinating women who are breastfeeding women who are pregnant and women who are trying to get pregnant the recommendation that women who are breastfeeding pregnant or planning pregnancy get vaccinated has only gotten stronger over time said michael leonardi md a maternal and fetal medicine specialist for osf healthcare the covid vaccines are some of the most thoroughly studied drugs we have ever given  in particular to pregnant women the best way to take care of a baby in utero is to take care of the mother who is carrying the baby the best way to take care of a newborn is to ensure the people caring for the newborn are vaccinated and covidfree women who are vaccinated before or during pregnancy make antibodies against covid19 which cross the placenta into the baby just like antibodies against anything the mother has ever been infected with or vaccinated against these antibodies are detectable in the baby breast milk too has been shown to have antibodies against covid19 in women who received the vaccination while pregnant or after delivery breast milk is an amazing gift that mothers give their children dr leonardi said being vaccinated enriches that gift by potentially providing some protection against covid weigh the risks there is data showing that pregnant women who get covid  regardless of severity  are at increased risk for preeclampsia and preterm birth which can have lifelong consequences for the baby dr leonardi said there is also very concerning data coming from areas with high rates of covid19 in pregnant women due to low vaccination rates and high community prevalence that shows at least a doubling of the risk for stillbirth in women infected with covid19 at any time during pregnancy according to the cdc pregnant women are three times more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit 29 times more likely to require ventilation 24 times more likely to need an oxygenation pump and 15 times more likely to die than women who arent pregnant older pregnant women (ages 3544) are at particularly high risk and were nearly four times more likely to require invasive ventilation they are twice as likely to die too and women who are severely ill with covid19 in the third trimester can pass the infection to the fetus in utero or at delivery the increased risk for a severe outcome is likely related to changes within your body during pregnancy including increased oxygen consumption and decreased lung capacities the risk of getting infected and suffering serious harm is far greater in pregnant women than the risk posed by getting the vaccine dr leonardi said class= as with all medications in pregnancy you should make your decision based on the best available information about the effectiveness of the medication the potential risks of the medication and the risk of the disease if the medication is not received you should also consider your exposure risk the prevalence of the virus in your community and any pregnancyrelated health issues like gestational diabetes that may increase your risk for serious illness from covid19 vaccine risk believed to be low there is no data to indicate the vaccines are dangerous to women who are pregnant or breastfeeding in addition the new england journal of medicine published results of a study of 3958 pregnant women where findings did not indicate any significant safety concerns for those who receive the mrna covid19 vaccines further the study found that any adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes in those vaccinated against covid19 who had a completed pregnancy were similar to incidences reported in studies involving pregnant women during prepandemic times and please remember getting vaccinated does not reduce your need to continue following all public health safety guidelines that means masking washing your hands often and minding your distance when youre in public																
199	1	A difficult beginning my name is sofija igonkina from latvia i have been living in england for 15 years im a nurse and i work in evergreen nursing home in hastings i want to share my story about why i had the covid19 vaccine and why im going to get a booster jab this winter last year was very difficult for everyone particularly at the beginning of the pandemic when we went into lockdown we stopped letting visitors in and our residents lives changed completely as contact with family was limited to phone or video calls instead of having a lovely christmas last year covid19 came into the home and changed everything despite our best efforts many of our residents contracted the virus including myself and most of the staff in 13 years of working in evergreen i have never felt so helpless devastated and emotionally broken in a short period of time we lost half of our residents i cannot express how hard it is to see people dying in front of your eyes whom you have looked after for many years i cried nearly every day at home and at work i had to do it so that no one could see it because i have to be strong and be a role model for my colleagues covid19 changed our lives covid19 vaccine vial and syringe [image supplied by freepikcom] a moment of acceptance in january i decided to get vaccinated i wanted to protect myself our residents and my family i do not wish anyone to go through what we went through last christmas when we heard on the news that a vaccine had been developed and my manager asked if i wanted to have it i said no at first i didnt trust a vaccine made so quickly could protect us from a virus science knew little about but i changed my mind when when i myself contracted covid19 and saw so many residents become infected too and now i want to say thank you to the scientists for being able to make an effective vaccine in such a short time many people will say that because i work as a nurse it is my responsibility to get vaccinated to protect the elderly people i care for it is true as social care workers many of the people we care for are at high risk from covid19 i also think we all have a duty to do what we can to protect each other it is better to prevent something in advance than deal with the consequences and have to live with them afterwards this is why i would recommend everyone gets vaccinated this winter having a covid19 booster vaccination will help top up your immunity and give you greater protection against the virus this winter together we can prevent the spread of the virus protect each other and those in our care who are most at risk																
200	1	One thing is universal with parents  their number one concern is the health and safety of their children the covid19 pandemic has exacerbated the typical level of parental worry many parents just taking it one day at a time as the virus and its effects on our local and global community continue to evolve i am with you i feel the strain i am both a pediatrician and a parent of young children i am the proud mother of two boys blake 7 and dillon 5 they are my world my pride and joy the two things most precious to me in life protecting them is my top priority always thats why i chose to get my children vaccinated against covid19 as soon as the vaccine was made available to children ages 5 to 11 years old taking my boys to receive their vaccine was one of the greatest feelings of relief ive felt in nearly two years when taking my children to their appointment i knew this was one step i could take to protect them from this terrible virus as a pediatrician and parent this is my message to parents please get your children ages 5 and older vaccinated against covid19 first the vaccine is safe the vaccine for ages 511 is a lower kidsized dose its efficacy has been proven and its recommended by the centers for disease control (cdc) the american academy of pediatrics (aap) and our physicians at advocate childrens hospital the technology used to develop the mrna isnt new  its in fact decades old the clinical trials for the covid19 vaccines faced the same rigor applied to all vaccine trials and the results were reviewed and approved by multiple independent advisory panels second the side effects seen in children thus far have been much milder than those in adults they may experience some of the common side effects such as headaches muscle pain fatigue or fever but these temporary effects pale in comparison to the potential for serious illness caused by covid19 the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks if you have questions about the vaccine i encourage you to talk to your childs pediatrician resist the urge to scan social media  theres so much misinformation floating in that space your childs pediatrician will be happy to take a visit or call from you to talk you through any concerns hesitations or questions you might have more than ever as doctors were doing our best to understand the variety of feelings our parents are going through during this trying time we are here for you and we care for your children like our own as a mother and a physician i have no doubts in my professional recommendation to parents i urge you to get your eligible children vaccinated it is your best shot at protecting them from covid19 and keeping them safe																
201	1	I was getting ready to set up pinch chinese for our usual delivery and takeout service in early february when gov andrew cuomo announced that indoor dining was coming back to new york city as the sommelier at the restaurant i felt a bit of relief thinking this might allow pinch to survive past the spring but at the same time i was filled with dread at this point restaurant workers like me were ineligible for the vaccine and therefore at risk of being infected with covid19 cuomos decision prompted an outcry from industry coalitions like restaurant workers community foundation food journalists and everyone in between astoundingly and perhaps due to backlash the governor quickly expanded the phase 1b group to include restaurant workers but passed the buck of doling out these vaccines to local municipalities if they think it works within their prioritization locally a vaguely worded addition i understood as restaurant workers were permitted to receive the vaccineonly if there was enough left over since the beginning of the pandemic weve been ostensibly classified as essential but its become clearer to me that restaurant workers are considered a different kind of essential laborers who do what others dont want to do not just making food and taking care of customers but catering to their wants not their needs thats not all we do in the most platonic ideal restaurants serve communities we encourage our neighbors to get to know each other we provide business to a myriad of vendors and strengthen ties within the local economy we celebrate all the happy occasions with our guests and commiserate with them when things are bleak (unfortunately in trying to make everything look and feel good the industry has perpetuated white supremacy by ignoring rampant problems of abuse sexual harassment racism and xenophobia) in the covid era every one of those acts of service is diminished and that hospitality cannot be translated into something that is packaged and delivered but even before the pandemic restaurant work has been considered a transition job something to make money while the career of our dreams sorts itself out as restaurant employees weve felt like afterthoughts cuomo is not the first to pass the buck instead of restaurant owners paying workers wages that can keep up with the cost of living they are happy to foist that responsibility onto the customers under the guise of tipping and delivery fees instead of the government providing crucial legal aid and financial assistance to independent restaurants during the pandemic their lack of action allows the free market to dictate who gets to survive at the whims of landlords and those who have all the resources thanks to latestage capitalism instead of a public that prioritizes the health and safety of others and values the efforts of its essential workers american consumers have given into convenience and comfort at their expense in every instance restaurant workers have had to bear the brunt of these policy changes and customer entitlements and rereopening announcements by ourselves constantly weighing the importance of our individual and collective economic solvency over the potential risk of contracting and spreading the virus the vaccine is the carrot at the end of the stick in late january a study out of ucsf found that prioritizing workers in food and agricultural sectors can significantly decrease covid mortality rates those considered to be on the frontlinenamely grocery workers food processors and farmers who are crucial to protecting the food supply chainhave received vaccine allowances fairly quickly after vulnerable populations and first responders but vaccine availability for restaurant workers has only come after decisions have been made to reopen indoor dining such as in new york city and detroit or where restaurants have remained open but with low indoor capacities as in los angeles and washington dc the view it seems is that the financial health of a restaurant and the radiating effect on the national economy are prioritized over the humans who work in those restaurants subscribe get unlimited recipes from bon appetit & epicurious for just $40 $30 subscribe a restaurant job is by no means a death sentence but it is to say the least much riskier than it was mere months before as we face more transmissible and potentially more lethal variants of the virus and find that indoor dining can be a vector for its spread we also cannot ignore the disproportionate effect of that risk on people of color as we weigh our colleagues need to work against all available data despite contraction numbers and hospitalizations going up the push to reopen indoor dining relegates the needs of the laborers last after the owners the landlords the vendors and the guests we are essential yet disregarded the vaccine looks like a silver bullet a boon a waypoint to what once was the before times but it only reveals that essential workers are and have always been unseen and unheard the moment cuomo decided to add restaurant workers to the vaccine eligibility list i searched three websitesa state site an nyc site and another organized by volunteers on twitter (hooray bureaucracy)to book my first dose appointment as soon as i could i can only imagine what it would be like if i didnt speak english or didnt have computer or internet access i felt like i was in line for a black friday sale searching for any open time slot willing to travel anywhere feeling manic the next day i found myself at a high school in queens inside a gym with tables carefully distanced and lots of volunteers the woman administering my vaccine was wearing her hijab a face mask a surgical shield a disposable overcoat and those same singleuse blue gloves that i use in the restaurant we struggled to meet each others eyes hers were tired after seeing so many people mine were anxious after seeing very few but in them we noticed each of us trying to smile the layers of the american experience distilled in a moment when we struggled to communicate because of the things on our bodies trying to protect us from each other one cold injection and a sore arm later i gathered what was left of my emotions and wept into my sleeve as i waited for another volunteer to help me make a second appointment relief anger comfort and guilt washed over me as i sat by myself meditating over my deed done for civic responsibility the purpose of the vaccine was laid bare then i didnt get it so i could go back to work but so i could plan for a future thats better for my colleagues hopefully with government support and a deeper understanding from guests of the skill our labor entails not so i can take care of myself but so i can take care of others and cater to their needs because this is a calling not a backup gig restaurants are centers for the future where minds and souls can be nourished where timeless ingredients can interact in a way that is exciting and fresh and where we can begin to consider what kind of work is truly essential restaurant workers understand this burden and this joy maybe just this once consider us																
202	1	Scientists scrutinized pfizer vaccine recipients blood samples to learn exactly what effects the vaccine exerts on the bodys immune system july 17 2021  by bruce goldman man receives dose of a covid19 vaccine stanford undergraduate student houston heimuli is inoculated with a covid19 vaccine steve fisch the second dose of a covid19 vaccine induces a powerful boost to a part of the immune system that provides broad antiviral protection according to a study led by investigators at the stanford university school of medicine the finding strongly supports the view that the second shot should not be skipped despite their outstanding efficacy little is known about how exactly rna vaccines work said bali pulendran phd professor of pathology and of microbiology and immunology so we probed the immune response induced by one of them in exquisite detail the study published july 12 in nature was designed to find out exactly what effects the vaccine marketed by pfizer inc has on the numerous components of the immune response the researchers analyzed blood samples from individuals inoculated with the vaccine they counted antibodies measured levels of immunesignaling proteins and characterized the expression of every single gene in the genome of 242479 separate immune cells type and status the worlds attention has recently been fixed on covid19 vaccines particularly on the new rna vaccines said pulendran the violetta l horton professor ii he shares senior authorship of the study with kari nadeau md phd the naddisy foundation professor of pediatric food allergy immunology and asthma and professor of pediatrics and purvesh khatri phd associate professor of biomedical informatics and of biomedical data science the studys lead authors are prabhu arunachalam phd a senior research scientist in pulendrans lab medical student madeleine scott phd a former graduate student in khatris lab and thomas hagan phd a former postdoctoral scholar in pulendrans stanford lab and now an assistant professor at the yerkes national primate research center in atlanta uncharted territory this is the first time rna vaccines have ever been given to humans and we have no clue as to how they do what they do offer 95% protection against covid19 said pulendran traditionally the chief immunological basis for approval of new vaccines has been their ability to induce neutralizing antibodies individualized proteins created by immune cells called b cells that can tack themselves to a virus and block it from infecting cells antibodies are easy to measure pulendran said but the immune system is much more complicated than that antibodies alone dont come close to fully reflecting its complexity and potential range of protection pulendran and his colleagues assessed goingson among all the immune cell types influenced by the vaccine their numbers their activation levels the genes they express and the proteins and metabolites they manufacture and secrete upon inoculation one key immunesystem component examined by pulendran and his colleagues was t cells searchanddestroy immune cells that dont attach themselves to viral particles as antibodies do but rather probe the bodys tissues for cells bearing telltale signs of viral infections on finding them they tear those cells up in addition the innate immune system an assortment of firstresponder cells is now understood to be of immense importance its the bodys sixth sense pulendran said whose constituent cells are the first to become aware of a pathogens presence although theyre not good at distinguishing among separate pathogens they secrete starting gun signaling proteins that launch the response of the adaptive immune system  the b and t cells that attack specific viral or bacterial species or strains during the week or so it takes for the adaptive immune system to rev up innate immune cells perform the missioncritical task of holding incipient infections at bay by gobbling up  or firing noxious substances albeit somewhat indiscriminately at  whatever looks like a pathogen to them a different type of vaccine the pfizer vaccine like the one made by moderna inc works quite differently from the classic vaccines composed of live or dead pathogens individual proteins or carbohydrates that train the immune system to zero in on a particular microbe and wipe it out the pfizer and moderna vaccines instead contain genetic recipes for manufacturing the spike protein that sarscov2 the virus that causes covid19 uses to latch on to cells it infects in december 2020 stanford medicine began inoculating people with the pfizer vaccine this spurred pulendrans desire to assemble a complete report card on the immune response to it bali pulendran bali pulendran the team selected 56 healthy volunteers and drew blood samples from them at multiple time points preceding and following the first and second shots the researchers found that the first shot increases sarscov2specific antibody levels as expected but not nearly as much as the second shot does the second shot also does things the first shot doesnt do or barely does the second shot has powerful beneficial effects that far exceed those of the first shot pulendran said it stimulated a manifold increase in antibody levels a terrific tcell response that was absent after the first shot alone and a strikingly enhanced innate immune response unexpectedly pulendran said the vaccine  particularly the second dose  caused the massive mobilization of a newly discovered group of firstresponder cells that are normally scarce and quiescent first identified in a recent vaccine study led by pulendran these cells  a small subset of generally abundant cells called monocytes that express high levels of antiviral genes  barely budge in response to an actual covid19 infection but the pfizer vaccine induced them this special group of monocytes which are part of the innate museum constituted only 001% of all circulating blood cells prior to vaccination but after the second pfizervaccine shot their numbers expanded 100fold to account for a full 1% of all blood cells in addition their disposition became less inflammatory but more intensely antiviral they seem uniquely capable of providing broad protection against diverse viral infections pulendran said the extraordinary increase in the frequency of these cells just a day following booster immunization is surprising pulendran said its possible that these cells may be able to mount a holding action against not only sarscov2 but against other viruses as well pulendran is

204	1	Share to facebook share to twitter in our last article we discussed breakthrough infections, which occur when someone who has been vaccinated gets covid-19. Breakthrough infections lead a lot of people to ask the question, why should i get vaccinated if i can still get covid-19? The answer is because if youre vaccinated you will not get as seriously sick and are less likely to die. In addition, you will help to stop this pandemic. The more people who are infected in a population the higher the prevalence level of the virus and increased risk for everyone. Unvaccinated individuals contribute to the number of people who can possibly get sick and provide a host for covid-19 to replicate and create more variants. The more the virus spreads, the greater risk of mutation that could possibly be more dangerous than what weve seen so far. While vaccinated people can get covid -19 and can spread it to others, youre less likely to get covid-19 if youre vaccinated, and it spreads less easily in vaccinated people. Related links is the vaccine riskier than getting covid? Why does everyone want me to get vaccinated? What is a breakthrough infection? This is also why its important to continue to follow the mandated health safety guidelines laid out by the cdc. Everyone wants to get back to regular life and avoid further isolation. The only way to do that is for the unvaccinated to get vaccinated and for the vaccinated to wear masks and take public health precautions. Typically, when people hear the words public health they think of somebody elses health, but it is your health. Covid-19 is a public health issue. Its similar to drinking and driving. When you drink and drive you are choosing to put other peoples safety at risk. Its why laws have been set in place to prevent this behavior. Not being vaccinated is choosing to put other peoples health at risk. At this moment, we dont clearly know the long-term affects of covid-19. But we have already seen some serious side effects for individuals that have had it, including difficulty breathing or shortness of breath tiredness or fatigue symptoms that get worse after physical or mental activities (also known as post-exertional malaise) difficulty thinking or concentrating (sometimes referred to as brain fog) cough chest or stomach pain headache fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations) joint or muscle pain pins-and-needles feeling diarrhea sleep problems fever dizziness on standing (lightheadedness) rash mood changes change in smell or taste changes in menstrual period cycles the covid-19 vaccine is federally approved by the united states food and drug administration (fda), which means that its met rigorous guidelines set for vaccine approval. The fda does not take vaccine approval lightly because they are developed to keep people alive and healthy. We know that getting the vaccine is not riskier than getting covid-19. At the end of the day, we all want the same thing, for covid-19 to go away and to be eradicated. If covid-19 continues to have hosts it will continue to spread and duplicate. Getting vaccinated is not only for yourself, but its for your family, your community, and future generations.																
205	1	With 76% of the total population having received at least one covid-19 vaccination, attention has shifted to how we can protect the youngest children. The advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) and centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) now recommends covid-19 vaccination for children aged 6 months through 4 years. This means that approximately 18 million children, or 5.5% of the u. S. Population, are now eligible to receive a vaccine. This is an opportunity for the country to catch up to vaccination goals and is a crucial step toward beating the pandemic. Like adults and teens who contracted covid-19, children can spread the disease when they are asymptomatic. In addition, although children may have milder symptoms when infected with covid-19, there are still many cases of children getting severe lung infections and requiring hospitalization. Other complications, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (mis-c), may require intensive care or result in long-lasting symptoms. And while children are less likely to have severe illness initially, they are susceptible to long covid symptoms long after initially recovering from their illness. Vaccinating your children can help protect them and your family and bring the pandemic to an end faster. Here are the top 5 reasons experts recommend vaccinating your children: 1. Covid-19 vaccines can help prevent your children from getting covid-19 everyone is at risk for contracting covid-19, and symptoms can be severe at any age. Especially considering the more contagious omicron variant, children are at risk for contracting and spreading the virus. The cdc now recommends the covid-19 vaccine for children ages 6 months through 4 years after reviewing research findings from pfizer showing that their covid-19 vaccine is effective in reducing the risk of infection and severe covid-19 illness. The covid-19 vaccine has been safely administered to millions of children ages 5-17 and shows good protection against infection and severe disease. 2. It can help your family get back to a more normal life vaccinating your children reduces their risk of being infected with covid-19, which can help keep them from being sick. This means that they can stay in school and continue their education uninterrupted, and they will be more likely to be able to participate in sports and clubs and return to fun activities like play dates and spending time with friends outside of the house. Depending on your schools policies, vaccinated children without symptoms may not be required to quarantine after exposure to someone who tested positive for covid-19, which also helps keep children in school and parents working uninterrupted. 3. It protects your family, friends and teachers vaccination not only reduces the risk of your child becoming infected, but it also slows the spread of the disease by preventing it from being passed onto others at school, like teachers, staff, and school administrators. This means there are less likely to be disruptions in education because of a teacher calling in sick. Vaccinating your child can prevent the spread to other family members as well, especially older adults who are the most vulnerable to severe illness. Lastly, vaccination can protect your children from spreading the virus to their friends. Because vaccines reduce the likelihood of transmission of the virus, it also reduces the chance for the virus to mutate into variants which might be more infectious or resistant to vaccines. The reduction in infections overall leads to fewer hospitalizations and deaths in the community and slows the emergence of new coronavirus variants such as the omicron variant. 4. It sets an example for others in your community for decades, vaccines for infectious diseases have been recommended for children and are a mandatory public health measure in many school systems. Parents who are vocal and enthusiastic about vaccinating their kids should encourage others in their community to act as well. Talking to your kids about the benefits of vaccinations may additionally motivate them to spread a positive message among their friends. A study done by the kaiser family foundation found that one in five parents will immediately vaccinate their kids under age 5, which will protect other family members, friends and school staff/faculty. You play a critical role in encouraging other parents to vaccinate their kids and make the right decisions for their family. 5. The vaccine is safe the most recent studies show that the vaccine is safe and effective in the 22 million children aged 5-17 who have been fully vaccinated for covid-19. The likelihood of severe side effects from the vaccine are rare, though normal side effects like a sore arm, mild headache, and fatigue, which also occur in adults, can be expected. Additionally, current studies show no long-term effects from the covid-19 vaccine, but they continue to be studied  this is how science and medicine moves forward. Some parents have concerns about how quickly the vaccine was developed and approved. Vaccine testing is and has historically been a rigorous process. Policies and scientific consensus changes when new data emerges  this is a good thing which ensures that public health and safety are prioritized. Its important to know that scientists did not take risky shortcuts on the science. Because development of a covid-19 vaccine was such a priority around the world, an incredible number of resources were put into these studies and the scientists worked tirelessly to ensure that standard scientific design was adhered to. Scientists already knew quite a bit about coronaviruses from previous breakouts, and the technology behind mrna vaccines had been in development for over a decade. The studies were able to be conducted very quickly because so many people volunteered, and the review process was sped up because committee hearings and data reviews were prioritized.

206	1	(inside science) -- covid-19 vaccines could provide stronger, longer-lasting immunity than recovering from the disease itself, say experts. Most people who recover from covid-19 probably enjoy some degree of protection against getting the disease again. Both the strength of that protection and how long it lasts remain open questions, with the answers complicated by a mixture of conflicting evidence. Some studies suggest the virus that causes covid-19 may interfere with immune memory, leaving people vulnerable to repeat infections months or years later. But even if that's true, there is no reason to think vaccines, once approved and available, would suffer from the same limitations. "we're thinking that with the vaccines, we should be able to do better than nature, " said peter doherty, a nobel prize-winning immunologist at the university of melbourne's doherty institute in australia. More covid-19 reporting from inside science how nobel-winning research is helping battle covid-19 fighting misinformation about a novel disease disgust evolved to protect us from disease. Is it working? How the immune system remembers covid-19 there are several ways the immune system can "remember" a virus after an infection has been vanquished. One involves b cells, which produce the virus-busting structures known as antibodies. Some b cells continue to produce antibodies even after an infection clears, while others linger in a dormant state until they are reactivated. Another type of immune memory involves killer t cells, which attack human cells that have been infected and turned into virus factories. Killer t cells reach their highest concentrations during infection, but a small population may remain for decades, ready to launch a faster response next time. New research that is not yet peer reviewed indicates b cell and t cell immunity may remain strong six months after infection with sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19. But it's not clear how much longer that protection will last, and there are other studies suggesting that both types of immune memory may be impaired by the disease. "what this virus is doing is in some way compromising aspects of our immune response, " said doherty. "we do think long-term immunity following infection is problematic. " in a study published last month in the journal cell, researchers examined the lymph nodes of people who had died of covid-19 and found they lacked structures called germinal centers. Germinal centers are where b cells mature into long-lived forms that produce better antibodies -- antibodies customized to bind strongly to a specific enemy. The process is similar to darwinian natural selection, with b cells going through repeated rounds of genetic mutation. Mutated b cells that produce better antibodies are sent back to mutate again; b cells that produce worse antibodies die. Image lymph nodes with germinal centers present and absent lymph nodes from a person with covid-19 (upper right) and a non-infected person (lower left). The yellow parts in the non-infected person's lymph nodes are germinal centers. In the infected patient's lymph nodes, germinal centers are largely absent. Media credits shiv pillai and naoki kaneko media rights this image may only be reproduced with this inside science article. While the body can produce effective b cells without germinal centers, those b cells tend not to last as long as ones that have been through the germinal center process, said shiv pillai, director of the immunology graduate program at harvard medical school, who conducted the study with his colleagues. If covid-19 prevents people from forming germinal centers, said pillai, that could mean people can only produce antibodies for a limited time after infection. The researchers could only examine lymph nodes from deceased people, so the germinal center problem might only crop up when illness is severe, noted godelieve de bree, an internist and infectious disease specialist at amsterdam university medical centers in the netherlands, who is studying covid-19 antibodies. Immunologist michel nussenzweig at rockefeller university in new york agreed, saying that findings from deceased patients do not necessarily indicate anything about people who recover. "i think you see a problem with everything in people [who] are dying, " said nussenzweig. Further evidence leads to conflicting interpretations. Pillai noted that antibodies collected from covid-19 patients during and soon after infection have few of the telltale mutations that would indicate they have been through germinal centers. That's true regardless of the severity of illness, suggesting that immune memory from b cells may be limited even in mild and moderate cases, according to pillai. But nussenzweig's team recently found evidence that mutation levels are higher six months after infection, suggesting that long-lived b cells may develop gradually after people are well. There are also hints that killer t cells may be impaired by covid-19. In a study published in september in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences, researchers led by katherine kedzierska at the doherty institute found that killer t cell counts in covid-19 patients didn't rise nearly as much as the researchers expected, and there was no sign that any remained after recovery to provide immune memory. Even at the height of infection, there were only a tenth as many killer t cells for the covid-19 virus as a typical person has left over from influenza a infections sometime in the past. "the killer t cell system in this virus seems to be compromised. It's not as good as it should be, " said doherty, who also took part in the study. He added that the study only looked at one of several types of killer t cells involved in covid-19, and more research is needed. So how long can people who recover from covid-19 expect to be protected? It's still unclear, and opinions are divided. Pillai suspects most covid-19 patients will lose any protection they gained from b cells and antibodies within a year of recovery, and potentially sooner. De bree thinks immunity may last around a year, as that's how long it lasts in other coronaviruses that cause seasonal colds. It's now clear that reinfections can happen. As of nov. 11, there are 421 suspected and 25 confirmed cases of people being infected twice, according to a tracker maintained by the dutch news organization bno news. In most cases, the second illness has been mild or asymptomatic, but one man in nevada came down with severe covid-19 barely more than a month after recovering from a milder version. Nussenzweig noted that those reinfection numbers are low, considering the millions of people who have been infected. But with the pandemic less than a year old, it is still early days. "i think it would be very important not to depend on getting immunity from being infected, " said pillai. Why a vaccine could be better than nature if it turns out that covid-19 does leave people vulnerable after recovery, why should researchers expect a vaccine to provide longer-lasting protection? A few decades ago, they might not have. For diseases like measles, mumps and hepatitis b, all a vaccine has to do is mimic nature, since people naturally develop lifelong immunity after infection. But many viruses avoid or manipulate the immune system in ways that leave people open to repeat infections. Modern vaccine development aims to correct for such problems. "our goal in this case is to definitely do better than natural immunity, " said barney graham, deputy director of the vaccine research center at the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. Graham helped isolate and stabilize the viral spike protein that is being used in many covid-19 vaccine candidates, including the vaccine from pfizer and biontech that made headlines on monday after the companies announced promising early results from a clinical trial. Graham's team is now collaborating with the biotechnology company moderna on another covid-19 vaccine candidate. One example of a vaccine that typically provides better immunity than a natural infection is the hpv vaccine, which protects against strains of human papillomavirus that cause cervical cancer. Hpv spends most of its time hiding inside cells of the skin and the lining of the cervix without doing anything to draw the attention of the immune system, said richard schlegel, a virologist and pathologist at georgetown university medical center in washington, who helped develop the vaccine in the 2000s. In contrast, vaccination involves injecting viral proteins directly into the muscle, and from there the proteins spread throughout the body -- a challenge the immune system can't ignore. Afterward, the trained immune cells can recognize hpv proteins wherever they crop up, even in the tiny quantities produced by natural infections. Covid-19 presents a different set of challenges, including the possibility that the virus may be thwarting aspects of the immune systems memory. A vaccine may be able to get around this, researchers say. Many of the vaccine candidates dont use the whole virus, delivering instead a single viral protein or protein fragment to stimulate the immune system. Some vaccines deliver the protein directly, while others deliver a gene that induces the body to produce the protein in its own cells. Researchers might not understand exactly how sars-cov-2 manipulates the immune system, but it likely takes more than a single protein. "we're taking away all those other viral genes that are probably screwing up the immune response, " said doherty. Many vaccines also include substances called adjuvants that enhance the immune response and guide it in certain directions, said graham. And in some cases, vaccines can be delivered in multiple doses to further boost their effects. Even with such advantages, a covid-19 vaccine probably won't make people completely immune for the rest of their lives. Graham expects vaccinated people will still be susceptible to infection, but will fight off such infections quickly, hopefully before feeling sick. Some people will probably still transmit the virus to others, but not as often. People may also need yearly booster shots. That may not sound like the magic bullet some people are hoping for. But if a vaccine can be proven safe and effective and made widely available, it could offer a path forward, out of a crisis that is still crippling economies and killing thousands of people around the world each day. "everything is telling us, if you want to be protected, whether you got infected or not -- please, get vaccinated, " said pillai.																
207	1	Getting the covid-19 vaccine should not even be up for debate. It should be mandatory for everyone who can obtain the shot to do so. Yet, it has become such a point of contention. The covid-19 vaccine many people are skeptical of the covid vaccine. Researchers say that those who are rejecting a covid vaccine are increasing their risk of contracting and transmitting the virus. They could also potentially lengthen the pandemic, leading to spikes in cases and providing the virus more chances to mutate. There should be exemptions for those that are allergic, pregnant, or have other legitimate reasons. However, everyone else must go out there, get vaccinated, and do their part when their time comes. We have a moral obligation to do so because of the potential threat we pose to other people if we do not get vaccinated. It is our civic duty. As research continues to reveal, the shots are safe for people and beneficial at preventing them from developing severe cases of covid-19, namely those that end in hospitalization and eventually death. Furthermore, many who have gotten covid have continued to suffer from other ailments that persist long after their initial illness. The longer it takes to achieve herd immunity, the longer it will take to get us out of the pandemic. Photo by shvets production from pexels my familys experience with the vaccine i am now fully vaccinated and experienced side effects with both doses of my vaccine. I had swelling, pain, and redness at the injection site for several days with the first one. I suffered from a low-grade fever, chills, fatigue, and body aches for the first couple of days with the second jab. I took a couple of tylenol and felt better almost immediately. My husband had no side effects, and my son only had a mild headache after the second dose. My daughter suffered side effects similar to mine. Women have more robust immune systems, so they seem to suffer more side effects from the vaccine. All things considered, i would still take the vaccine as (in my opinion) getting covid would be far worse than all the side effects of both vaccine jabs combined. There will be a third dose of the vaccine  a so-called booster dose  to fight against the new coronavirus variants that have developed. We will most likely need to get a booster dose annually. When the time comes, i will roll up my sleeve and take those shots also. Final thoughts experts estimate that herd immunity would require at least 70% of the population to have covid-19 immunity, either through prior infection or vaccination. The only way we will ever reach herd immunity is if everyone gets vaccinated. The longer it takes to achieve herd immunity, the longer it will take to get us out of the pandemic and return to a way of life we all once knew. As they say, it takes a village. Together, we will get through this.																
208	1	There is a lot of discussion right now about the side effects of the covid-19 vaccine and confusion surrounding the taking of the vaccine. However, if we dissect these discussions, we will find that the logical conclusion is to take the vaccine in order to protect yourselves and others during the pandemic. Risk of blood clots for all latest news, follow the daily star's google news channel. This is one of the most widely debated side effects of covid-19 vaccines. Let us use an example to understand the risks. The johnson and johnson covid-19 vaccines have been given to about seven million people in the united states, but the vaccine has been temporarily paused due to possible blood clots in six vaccine recipients. It is normal to have such a temporary pause. In the meantime, the us food and drug administration (fda) and centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) will examine if blood clotting has anything to do with the vaccination. Doctors will also be informed during this time on how to treat such side effects if they potentially occur in other persons. It is expected that the fda will soon lift the pause and reintroduce the vaccine to the public. But most importantly, if someone becomes seriously ill after being infected with the coronavirus, their chances of blood clots are many, many times higher. It is safe to say that the cases of vaccines causing blood clots are extremely rare and even if that occurs, it is thought that about 85 percent of cases can be cured through treatment. Any widely used drug (such as paracetamol or antacids) is not 100 percent risk free. Vaccines have some side effects too, which is normal and acceptable. Covid-19 is killing 10,000 to 12,000 people every day around the world. Now, think how extremely rare the chances are, if there are any, of blood clots forming from covid-19 vaccination versus how many people are dying from covid-19 each day. No doubt, the benefits of the approved covid-19 vaccines far outweigh the risks, and that is why the european medicines agency and who are constantly advocating that people take the vaccine. Can vaccinated people get infected, and why is the second dose so critical? People are also worried about the fact that a minority of vaccinated individuals are still being infected with the coronavirus even after taking the covid-19 vaccine. This is because taking the first dose of a two-dose vaccine develops only partial immunity, so do not neglect to take the second dose of the vaccine. Because the immune system is not completely functional with the first dose of the vaccine, it is important to follow perfectly the protective measures even after the first dose. Immunity will be complete within two to three weeks of the second dose of vaccine. Therefore, the second dose cannot be omitted in any way. Can people who have fully completed the vaccine dose become infected with the coronavirus? The answer is that it is very unlikely, because if the coronavirus enters the body, the immune system will be activated very quickly in those vaccinated individuals and will kill the virus and keep us free from the disease. However, new variants of the coronavirus are being found around the globe, which is also a normal process. If the vaccine is made using the old variant of coronavirus, the effectiveness of the vaccine against the new variant of the virus might be reduced, so a small number of people who have been vaccinated (with both doses complete) may still be infected with the new variant of coronavirus. But the most important thing is that even if someone who has been vaccinated becomes positive for coronavirus, the person will develop mild to moderate symptoms as the vaccine will give protection. As a result, that person is highly unlikely to require hospitalisation. Why safe and effective covid-19 vaccine should be taken in sum, the possibility of blood clots as a result of the vaccine is extremely low. Even if a person is infected with a new variant of the coronavirus after receiving the vaccine, he or she will develop mild to moderate but not severe versions of the disease because vaccine-induced immunity will give protection, and he or she will not need to be hospitalised. There is no more effective way to eradicate viral diseases than vaccines. For example, smallpox has been eradicated from the world and polio has been eradicated from bangladeshboth were made possible due to vaccines. Vaccines are one of the most invaluable gifts of science and we should not squander this opportunity.																
209	1	Since the u. S. Food and drug administration (fda) authorized the first covid-19 vaccines, more than one hundred million people in the u. S. Have been vaccinated. You may be considering what the covid-19 vaccines mean for you and your family. Johns hopkins medicine views all authorized covid-19 vaccines as highly effective at preventing serious disease, hospitalization, and death from covid-19. To support you as you make your decision, here are 12 facts and insights, shared by sherita golden, m. D. , m. H. S. , chief diversity officer at johns hopkins medicine, who specializes in diabetes, heart conditions and patterns of disease in diverse communities. The covid-19 vaccine was created quickly, but was carefully tested for safety. The development of the covid-19 vaccines did not cut corners on testing for safety and efficacy. The vaccines were made using processes that have been developed and tested over many years, and which are designed to make  and thoroughly test  vaccines quickly in case of an infectious disease pandemic such as covid-19. The vaccines themselves were extensively tested by independent scientists, and more than 100 million people in the u. S. Have been safely vaccinated. An illustration of scientists and researchers with oversized symbols of vaccine research, such as microscopes, vials and syringes. Covid vaccine side effects are temporary and do not mean youre sick. The vaccines do not contain live coronavirus, and you cannot and will not get covid-19 from getting vaccinated. After the shots, you might experience a sore arm, a mild fever or body aches, but this doesnt mean you have covid-19. These symptoms, if they happen at all, are temporary, usually lasting only a day or two. They signal a natural response as your bodys immune system learns to recognize and fight the coronavirus. On the other hand, getting covid-19 can make you seriously ill, with symptoms that linger for months or even longer. Learn more about covid-19 vaccine safety. An illustration of a woman holding her arm in mild discomfort. Getting the covid-19 vaccine can protect you from getting sick. The covid-19 vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the coronavirus if you are exposed to it  including coronavirus variants such as delta. As the covid-19 pandemic continues, getting the vaccine is a powerful step in taking charge of your health. When given as directed, the fda-authorized vaccines can prevent severe covid-19 illness and death. An illustration of a young man wearing a mask, giving a thumbs-up after having received his vaccination. Diversity in covid-19 vaccine testing helped assess safety and effectiveness. Covid-19 affects everyone, so scientists made sure clinical trial participants for the vaccines were diverse. The clinical trials for the first two covid-19 vaccines included black (about 10% of participants) and hispanic (about 20% of participants) people, older age groups (about 25%), and people with conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and heart and respiratory conditions. The u. S. Study participants for the one-shot covid-19 vaccine were 15% hispanic/latinx; 13% black/african american; 6% asian and 1% native american. An illustration of two researchers wearing masks, examining data. Do you have allergies? You can probably still get the covid-19 vaccine. The cdc says people with allergies to certain foods, insects, latex and other common allergens can get a covid-19 vaccine. If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine, be sure to discuss that with your doctor, who can evaluate you and assess your risk. However, if you are severely allergic to any of the coronavirus vaccines ingredients, you should not be vaccinated. An illustration of a provider vaccinating a young man. People of color are especially vulnerable to severe covid-19. Generations of health inequities have caused black and hispanic/latin americans and other communities of color to be overrepresented in severe covid-19 cases and deaths. People of color are vulnerable to covid-19 risk factors, and are more likely to be working front-line, essential jobs that cannot be performed from home, increasing their chances of being infected. Getting vaccinated can provide protection for you and those you love. An illustration of an african american woman adjusting her son's face mask. If youve already had covid-19, getting the vaccine will add extra protection. A study published in august 2021 indicates that if you had covid-19 before and are not vaccinated, your risk of getting reinfected is more than two times higher than for those who were infected and got vaccinated. While evidence suggests there is some level of immunity for those who previously had covid, it is not known how long you are protected from getting covid-19 again. Plus, the level of immunity provided by the vaccines after having covid-19 is higher than the level of immunity for those who had covid but were not subsequently vaccinated. Getting vaccinated provides greater protection to others since the vaccine helps reduce the spread of covid-19. An illustration of two young men wearing masks, greeting one another by bumping elbows. Getting vaccinated for covid-19 helps others in your community. Older people and those living with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease and diabetes are more likely to experience severe  even fatal  cases of covid-19 if they catch it. The more people who receive the coronavirus vaccines, the sooner vulnerable people can feel safe among others. Also, since every covid-19 infection gives the coronavirus a chance to mutate, being vaccinated helps prevent variants. An illustration of a family wearing masks within a glass dome, protected by virus cells outside. More vaccinations for covid-19 mean a chance to get back to normal. After over a year of coronavirus pandemic closures, cancellations and postponements, everyone is eager to think about returning to work, school, sports, family celebrations and social activities. Though no one is sure when the pandemic will be over, every person who gets protection from the coronavirus by getting a vaccination helps us move closer to normal life. An illustration of masked people waiting in line to get vaccinated. Heres what we know about pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility concerns with the covid-19 vaccines. Johns hopkins medicine agrees with and strongly supports the recommendations of the cdc and other organizations who recommend that all pregnant or lactating individuals, along with those trying to get pregnant, be vaccinated against covid-19. Find out more about the vaccine and pregnancy. An illustration of a pregnant woman wearing a mask talking with her doctor. Covid-19 vaccines: time is of the essence. People hesitate to get vaccinated for covid-19 for many reasons, from personal views and fears to logistical problems getting to vaccine sites. But waiting too long to be vaccinated allows the coronavirus to continue spreading in the community, with new variants emerging. Severe covid-19 can be very dangerous: the sooner you get vaccinated, the sooner you are protected. An illustration of two doctors next to an oversized calendar; one of them is holding an oversized syringe, and there are vials and bandages sitting nearby. How can you decide if you should get the covid-19 vaccine? Do your research: your questions are important, and getting the right answers from reliable sources can add to your peace of mind. Talk to your family doctor and people you know who have been vaccinated and learn all you can about the covid-19 vaccine so you can make the most informed decision about getting vaccinated.																
210	1	I'm in my 20s and have no health problems. Infection rates are going down in my city, so why should i get a covid vaccine? As more and more people are vaccinated, the virus will have fewer people to infect, and community transmission will go down. Every person that gets vaccinated brings us one step closer to ending the pandemic. Not getting vaccinated puts you at much higher risk of severe covid-19, which can make you seriously sick for a long period of time and possibly cause lasting damageeven if youre young and healthy. We still dont know why covid causes such severe disease in some people, so its impossible to predict whether youll have a mild or serious case if you are exposed. Theres also the added convenience of being vaccinated! You dont have to quarantine if youve been exposed to someone who you later found out was infected with covid-19. And, if you end up traveling someplace that requires a vaccine, that will already be taken care of. Plus, at the end of the day, you will be protected against the disease, so you wont have to worry about getting other people sick or causing them to need to quarantine by accident. Source: johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health how do i get a covid-19 vaccine? Is it complicated? When vaccines first rolled out in the u. S. , there were limitations on eligibility and supply that made accessing appointments difficult for many people. Now, however, anyone over the age of 12 can choose from a variety of convenient options to get vaccinated. Some options to find a vaccination site near you in the u. S. : go to vaccines. Gov, enter your zip code, and a search radius up to 50 miles. Text your zip code to 438829 or call 1-800-232-0233 to find locations near you. Call or email your doctors office to ask if they are providing vaccines and, if not, if they have suggestions for where you can go. Once youve found a convenient site, you can make an appointment. Many sites are now offering open hours for walk-ins as well. Keep in mind: covid-19 vaccines are free, even if you are uninsured. If you receive a bill, speak to the person or facility that sent it. If they dont cancel it, contact 1-800-hhs-tips or visit tips. Hhs. Gov to file a complaint. No social security number or government id is necessary to get a vaccine. A facility may ask for this information to help confirm that you are uninsured, but you can still get vaccinated even if you cant provide these items. Everyone age 12 and up is eligible, regardless of immigration status. Vaccination will not affect your status or be shared with immigration agencies. Why arent the vaccines under emergency use authorization fully approved by the fda yet? Both pfizer and moderna have submitted applications for approval, and the fda is in the review process. The agency has not provided a timeline for review, but it is anticipated to take from several weeks to a couple of months. In the meantime, the fda has granted emergency use authorization for these and the johnson & johnson vaccine. All of the vaccines had to meet certain conditions for safety and efficacy in order to receive this authorization. Sources: joshua sharfstein and what is emergency use authorization? Given the side effects, is it worth it to get a covid vaccine? The side effects from covid vaccines can be uncomfortable for some people, but they usually last only a day or two and cause no lasting damageunlike covid infection, which can last for weeks and potentially months or years with long-term damage to the lungs, heart, and other organs. Its still unknown why some people get so severely ill from covid and others dont, but we do know that vaccines are safe and effective. Source: side effects and covid-19 vaccineswhat to expect why do covid vaccines cause more of a reaction than flu or hpv vaccines? Every vaccine has its own reactogenicity based on what it is made from, and each persons immune system has its own particular reaction to vaccines. Covid-19 vaccines might be, on average, more reactive than certain vaccines but less reactive than others. For example, it is less reactogenic than the smallpox and yellow fever vaccines. The flu vaccine is very well toleratedmuch more than many other vaccines. Covid vaccines are a little more like the shingles vaccine, which can also cause some side effects. With covid vaccines, common side effects like fever, sore arm, and muscle ache are typical signs that our bodies are reacting to the vaccine and a good signal that our immune system is beefing itself up. Source: covid-19 vaccines: verifying safety and identifying misinformation ive been hearing a lot about myocarditis. Am i at risk for this if i get a vaccine? The cdc is monitoring rare reports of myocarditis, or heart inflammation, in some teenagers. So far, the cases have been reported as mild and have resolved with medicine and rest. Its a situation that is being monitored and not a situation to be unduly concerned about. What is concerning: myocarditis occurs in much higher percentages with covid infectioneven in mild or asymptomatic infections. Your risks of having myocarditis are greater from getting covid than they are from getting vaccinated. Source: the covid-19 questions we dont have answers for yet i have health conditions that make me hesitant about getting the vaccine. Im worried that if i get the vaccine, my conditions will get worse within the upcoming months or years. There is no evidence that covid-19 vaccines can worsen underlying conditions. On the contrary, those who have underlying conditions are likely to benefit the most from the vaccine. Source: amesh adalja when will we know if we need booster shots for covid? A booster dose for covid-19 vaccines acts as a reminder to our immune system some time after initial vaccination. Its the same shot that is given if theres evidence of waning immunity. A second-generation covid vaccine is a modification to the original vaccine. These are targeted toward some of the variants that we may see causing breakthrough infections and more severe infections in people who are fully immunized. We dont know yet how long immunity from the original vaccines lasts, though there is some preliminary data showing lasting immunity after six months among participants of the phase 3 clinical trials for the pfizer and moderna vaccines. In the longer term, experts will look for a rise in covid-19 hospitalizations, severe disease, and deaths among fully vaccinated people as a red flag that boosters may be needed. Mild or asymptomatic illness is really not important in terms of considering breakthrough infections. We also dont know when we might need second-generation covid vaccines. The virus will mutate as it continues to circulate, but there is encouraging news: we have data showing high efficacy against severe covid and hospitalization from variants among fully vaccinated people. Sources: bill moss and anna durbin how protective are the current vaccines against the delta variant? Do we need to increase masking and social distancing? The vaccines are incredibly good at preventing people from becoming ill with and getting clinical covid-19 from the delta variant. If they do become infected, and maybe even have symptoms or mild symptoms, theyre less likely to transmit it. If youre fully vaccinated and living in a place where case numbers continue to fall because theres high vaccination coverage, i personally would feel safe going maskless in those circumstances. If youre living in a place where theres a lot of covid circulating, adding a mask in crowded indoor spaces is just an added layer of protection. Source: jennifer nuzzo what are the current recommendations for getting vaccinated while pregnant or breastfeeding? Covid-19 vaccines for pregnant and breastfeeding people are authorized by the fda. Currently, there are no known safety concerns regarding covid-19 vaccines and pregnant or breastfeeding people. Unvaccinated pregnant people who become infected with covid-19, however, are at higher risk of becoming severely ill, having complications, or even dying compared to people who are not pregnant. Therefore, pregnant people are encouraged to talk with their medical providers about receiving a covid-19 vaccine. Sources: johns hopkins medicine and cdc three of my female friends report very late (~4 weeks) periods that are also heavier than usual. Can you tell me what thats all about? Its possible that vaccines could indirectly affect the severity of menstrual cycles. Aches and pains post-vaccination could compound normal menstrual pains, and its possible that general stress could also play a role. This was not a side effect reported in any of the clinical trials from the vaccine manufacturers, however. Sources: johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health and amesh adalja i got my first dose and then missed my second dose appointment. Its now been six weeks. Is it too late to get a second shot? Do i even need one? Its very important to get both doses of two-dose vaccines like pfizer and moderna, especially for protection against variants. The first dose of the vaccine primes your immune system, and the second dose gives it a boost to help protect you. There is no reason to restart your series if youre past the scheduled second dose. The second dose will still give you the needed immunity when you receive itin fact, some argue that delayed second doses increase immunity.																
211	1	Now that an effective vaccine for covid-19 has been developed, the goal for health care experts is to help ensure public confidence in the vaccine. Theres also the need to emphasize that the benefits of the vaccine greatly outweigh mild potential side effects or inconvenience. The possibility of serious complications for anyone who gets the virus, and the public health consequences of the pandemic continuing its course, are strong reasons in favor of getting vaccinated. The following information is based on data from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), with additional comments from michael saag, md, professor and associate dean in the uab division of infectious diseases. The covid-19 vaccination will help keep you from getting the virus. Covid-19 vaccines were evaluated in clinical trials and have been approved because those studies show that the vaccine significantly reduces the probability of contracting the virus. Based on what has been proven about vaccines for other diseases, the covid-19 vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill, even if you do get the virus. Getting vaccinated also may protect people around you particularly those at greater risk for severe illness from covid-19. Dr. Saag says the true value of the vaccine is more easily seen when we consider what would happen if the development of a vaccine had failed. We would be faced with an exploding pandemic for which there was no end in sight, dr. Saag says. It might continue to burn through the population for another two to four years. Thats what we were facing until we were rescued with a modern day miracle. The virus was sequenced in december of 2019, and that genetic sequence was available to the world on january 10 of 2020. After development and expanded clinical trials, we got a vaccine that works. Dr. Saag compares the rapid development of a safe, highly effective vaccine to both a home run and an event that might be seen as divine intervention. First, scientists developed the strategy and drug quickly, dr. Saag says. Second, the resulting vaccine works at an almost unprecedented level of effectiveness. Third, the side-effect profile is the same as for most vaccines. You may get aches and fever that are gone in 36 hours, on average. So this is a walk-off, grand-slam home run in the last game of the world series that you rarely witness in medicine. But i also call it a miracle drug, and its fitting that we began vaccinations during two religious holidays that celebrate miracles. If this pandemic were a classic greek stage drama, the audience would see the vaccine as a deus ex machina, because the gods would have rescued us, the main character, from great danger. The vaccines do not affect or interact with our dna in any way. The covid-19 vaccines are a new type known as mrna (messenger rna) vaccines. Mrna vaccines give instructions to our cells to make a harmless piece of what is called the spike protein. The spike protein is found on the surface of the virus. Covid-19 mrna never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where dna (genetic material) is stored. Once the instructions are inside your muscle cells, the cells use them to make the protein piece, then the cells break down the instructions and get rid of them. Next, the cell places the protein piece on its surface. The immune system spots the protein and begins building an immune response and making antibodies to fight the infection. At the end of this process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection. Covid-19 vaccination is a safer way to help build protection. Covid-19 can bring serious, life-threatening complications. Even though it affects certain groups less seriously than others based on age, health, and other factors, it is still not possible to predict how covid-19 will affect any individual. Getting covid-19 may offer some natural protection, known as immunity. But experts dont know how long that immunity lasts, and the risk of severe illness and death from covid-19 far outweighs any benefits of natural immunity. Getting vaccinated creates an antibody response, so that you are protected without having to experience the illness. Both natural immunity and immunity produced by a vaccine are important aspects of covid-19 that experts are investigating. Health care officials and agencies plan to keep the public informed about new developments. Dr. Saag says getting infected with the covid-19 virus is the least desirable and least safe way to develop immunity. He speaks as a health care professional but also from experience. I actually had the virus myself, he says. It was harrowing. I was scared for eight days about what the next day would bring. I would watch my oxygen level drop. I knew what i was in store for if i had to be hospitalized and undergo intensive care. Each day i would get up feeling better, thinking i had beat this thing, only to have the symptoms spike again in the evening. It was like the repeated scenes in groundhog day for eight nights. That kind of experience, which, as we know, not everyone survives, can be prevented with the vaccine. So it makes complete sense to get the vaccine. Covid-19 vaccination is an important tool to help stop the pandemic. Stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools we have available. Wearing masks and social distancing help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others, but these measures are not enough. Vaccines work with your immune system, so it will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. The combination of getting vaccinated and following cdc recommendations to protect yourself and others provides the best protection from covid-19. Ending the covid-19 pandemic will halt the growing negative impact the virus is having on education, the economy, health care, and countless other activities of a functioning society. Dr. Saag notes that the public health benefit of the vaccine is the main reason for its use. This is how we end the pandemic, full stop, dr. Saag says. Once that is done, we can have a normal society again. We can enjoy daily life, family events, work, and school without distancing, without masks, and without fear. We will once again enjoy regular shopping trips and dining out and family vacations without constant worry about the consequences. We can have real holiday activities instead of virtual ones. Its very simple: we will get our lives back.																
212	1	What is an mrna vaccine and how does it workmost vaccines (or immunizations) work by injecting a weakened form of a disease germ into your body this is usually done with a shot in the arm or leg your body detects these germs and makes antibodies to fight them those protective antibodies then stay in your body for a long time in many cases they stay for the rest of your lifea messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) vaccine is a different kind of vaccine it works by giving your cells instructions that tell them to make a special protein called a spike protein your bodys immune cells respond to this spike protein just like they would to a weakened disease germ from a regular vaccine they make antibodies to fight it the spike protein instructions in the covid19 mrna vaccine help your body make antibodies that prevent the virus that causes covid19 (called sarscov2) from entering your cells and causing disease this keeps you from getting sickthe instructions from the mrna vaccine dont interact with your dna in any way in fact once the instructions are copied your body quickly breaks down the mrna and removes it from your systemhow does the johnson & johnson covid19 vaccine workthe johnson & johnson vaccine uses a modified adenovirus to introduce dna for the spike protein into cells adenoviruses typically cause the common cold but the virus in the vaccine has been modified so it cant replicate make copies of itself or cause disease this modified virus is simply a vehicle (like a car or bus) that transports the dna for the spike protein into cells where it is dropped off in the nucleus and instructs the cell to make the protein the viral dna does not interact or change your dna so it is very safe this technology has been studied for decades and has been used in other vaccines with no safety concernscan any of the vaccines cause covid19no none of the vaccines are live and they do not replicate so they do not cause disease the mrna vaccine doesnt actually contain the virus that causes covid19 and the johnson & johnson vaccine uses a different virus that does not cause covid19 the viral vector for this vaccine has been modified so it is not able to replicate or make copies of itself so it cant cause diseasewhat vaccines are availablethree vaccines for covid19 have been authorized for emergency use in the united states the us food and drug administration (fda) gave emergency use authorization (also called an eua) to the mrna vaccines developed by pfizerbiontech and moderna and to johnson & johnson (janssen) the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recommends the pfizerbiontech vaccine for people 5 and older and the moderna and johnson & johnson vaccines for people 18 and olderbecause children and adolescents can get covid19 just as easily as adults and can transmit it to others the cdc now recommends the pfizerbiontech covid19 vaccine for children 511 years old this vaccine is safe and effective and can reduce severe illness in children children in this age group receive two shots at a lower dosethe fda gave full approval to the pfizerbiontech covid19 vaccine in august 2021 this means the vaccine has been fully cleared for use in people ages 16 and older after rigorous research and monitoringwhat is the difference between emergency use authorization and approval by the fdafda emergency use authorization is used for a medicine or vaccine when limited longterm data is available but the benefits have been shown to outweigh the risks euas can only be used during a public health emergency such as the covid19 pandemic vaccines authorized with an eua will continue to be studied additional safety monitoring and education are also requiredwhy should i get a covid19 vaccineadult clinical trials for the vaccines showed that they are all effective at preventing severe covid19 disease hospitalizations and death due to covid19 in children trials showed the pfizerbiontech vaccine was 90

health insurance plans and highdeductible health plans it also includes people who dont have health insuranceduring the public health emergency insurance companies are required to cover the cost of giving the covid19 vaccines with no copay deductible or coinsurance for the patienthow many doses are neededboth mrna vaccines  pfizer and moderna  require 2 doses delivered by a syringe (a shot) the shots are scheduled 34 weeks apart depending on which vaccine you receive even though the vaccines are similar you should get the same vaccine both times for your primary series the johnson & johnson vaccine is given as a single doseto maximize protection again covid19 the cdc authorized booster shots for all people age 12 and older adults can safely mix and match booster doses which means you can receive a different vaccine than your original vaccine people age 1217 can only get the pfizer vaccine as a booster dosewhat are the side effects of the vaccinesthe vaccines can cause mild symptoms in some people this happens because the spike protein instructions tell the immune cells to make antibodies the most common reactions to the vaccine are pain at the injection site fever fatigue headache and muscle aches these side effects are very common with other vaccines including the flu shot they are a sign that the body is responding the way it should to a vaccinein rigorous clinical trials the vaccines showed no serious safety concerns or severe side effects however the cdc and the fda have continued to monitor for side effects as the vaccine is distributed to the public there have been a small number of people who had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to one of the vaccines but this is rare and most people will not have any issues but you will be asked about any history of reactions to vaccines or other injections just to be safe if you have concerns or questions about any side effects after getting the vaccine check with your family doctorhow long does immunity lastwe still dont know how long immunity lasts after you get a covid19 vaccine we also dont know how long immunity lasts after natural infection with the virus that causes covid19 we do know that being infected with seasonal coronaviruses (a source for the common cold) does not give longlasting immunity its why seasonal colds are so common every yearwith the delta and omicron variants we have seen reduced protection against mild and moderate disease over time booster doses extend your protection people who got an mrna vaccine (pfizerbiontech or moderna) should get a booster 5 months after the second dose is completed people who got the janssen (j&j) vaccine should get a booster at least 2 months laterdo i still need to wear a mask and physically distance if im fully vaccinated and have gotten a boosterthe vaccine protects you from getting very sick by keeping the sarscov2 virus from entering your cells and causing covid19 but the vaccine does not keep you from getting the virus and possibly spreading it also it takes a few weeks after the second dose of the vaccine to get the best protectioneven if youre vaccinated its important to wear masks and maintain physical distance especially when contagious variants like omicron are circulating this can prevent you from giving the virus to others and protects you by reducing the amount of virus exposureshould i get the vaccine if ive already had covid19yes as long as you are not currently sick we know that natural immunity to the virus that causes covid19 decreases over time theres not enough information from the covid19 vaccine studies to show how immunity from the vaccine compares to natural immunity its likely the vaccine will boost your immunity and keep you protected longerwho cant get the vaccinea vaccine is currently not available for children under the age of 5 some people should talk with their family doctor before getting the covid19 vaccine this includes people who have severe reactions to injected medicines and people who have weakened immune systems and chronic conditionsas with other vaccines people who have an allergy to any part of the vaccine should not get the shot people who have a fever or other symptoms may not be able to get the vaccine until theyre bettergrowing evidence indicates the vaccine is safe for people who are pregnant and breastfeeding it does not cause fertility problems the cdc now strongly recommends that all people who are pregnant recently pregnant are trying to get pregnant or might become pregnant get vaccinatedhow do i report side effects after getting the vaccineif you have side effects (also called adverse events) after getting the covid19 vaccine you should report them to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) talk with your family doctor if you have questions about what might be considered a side effect related to the vaccinethe cdc will also be using a new smartphonebased tool called vsafe to send text messages to encourage people to report any side effects information on vsafe will be given to everyone who gets the covid19 vaccine you will also get a card that tells you which vaccine and dose you were given and provides other information about the vaccine you must opt in to get vsafe text messages on your smartphone

recently the news accompanying this image has taken a positive turn with promising results from the covid19 vaccine trials its the iconic spikes of the coronavirus spikey blob that are a key part of how these vaccines worklets backtrack a little and start with the broader covid19 vaccine picture as of 1 december 2020 thirteen vaccines have reached the final stage of testing where they are being given to thousands of people to test if they protect against the sarscov2 virus though the end goal is the same these vaccines vary in the ways in which they try to trigger our immune system to recognise the virus all of these ways have been used in licensed vaccines for other diseases previously  except rna vaccinestwo vaccines which have recently reported results are rna vaccines produced by moderna and by pfizer & biontech other rna vaccines in the pipeline include those produced by curevac imperial college london and arcturus results so far have been overwhelmingly positive at the start of december pifzers vaccine became the first rna vaccine licensed for widespread use in the ukother types of vaccines often use inactive or weakened forms of a virus to trigger an immune response but rna vaccines use a viruss own genetic code against it rna stands for ribonucleic acid youre probably more familiar with dna the molecule which makes up human genetic code rna makes up the virus genetic code which contains instructions for the proteins the virus needs to makeearly in the pandemic chinese scientists were able to isolate samples of the sarscov2 virus and determine its genetic code this catalogued all the instructions the virus uses to make its various proteins these include the spikes of the coronavirus spikey blob its spike proteins the spike proteins are the structures that the virus uses to penetrate cells and kick off an infectionspike proteins are also key to how rna vaccines work scientists are able to make synthetic rna in a lab which codes for the virus spike protein using this synthetic rna we can hijack the processes which create proteins in our own cellsthe genetic material in our bodies is dna in the nucleus of our cells an enzyme splits apart the two strands that form dna to form singlestranded messenger rna the mrna moves out of the nucleus to our cells cytoplasm here molecules called ribosomes translate the rnas code into proteins in short the ribosome is like a proteinmaking factory and the mrna created from our dna is the blueprint for the proteins it makesrna vaccines take advantage of the fact that our ribosome factory doesnt care where a blueprint comes from so if we can smuggle a new blueprint for the virus spike protein into this factory the ribosome will assemble the protein without question once its manufactured the spike protein sticks to the surface of our cells and triggers a response from our immune systemsmuggling the blueprint into our cells isnt straightforward if we simply inject the rna on its own enzymes in our bodies would break it down before it could enter our cells for this reason its encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles tiny fat droplets around one billionth of a metre in diameter these nanoparticles shield the rna stopping it from breaking down and help it get taken up by our cellsamongst the covid19 vaccines there are two types of rna vaccine these are messenger rna (mrna) vaccines like those produced by moderna and pfizer/biontech and selfamplifying rna (sarna) vaccines like that developed by imperial college londonthe structures of mrna and sarna used in the vaccines are very similar but have one key difference both contain the region of the rna which codes for the virus spike protein both also contain a cap which stops the rna breaking down and helps start protein synthesis in our cells and a tail which helps stabilise the rna unlike mrna sarna also contains the code for a virus enzyme this enzyme helps create multiple copies of the virus rna once its in our cells leading to quicker protein productionas sarna produces more copies of itself once its in a cell it means that we can give vaccines containing it in smaller doses than mrna vaccines this means that the cost per dose is lower and that the same volume of vaccine produces more dosesrna stability is an important consideration for the way in which we store and transport these vaccines some need lowtemperature storage to remain stable the pfizer/biontech vaccine requires a transportation temperature of 70  c and can be stored for up to five days in a fridge after delivery the moderna vaccine requires a transportation temperature of 20  c and after thawing can be stored at refrigerator temperature for 30 days temperature matters chemical reactions happen more quickly at higher temperatures so low temperatures ensure the rna remains intactthough these vaccines will be the first licensed rna vaccines they are not the first to be developed theyve been under development for several years for other viruses including influenza hiv and zika theyre also not the first rnabased medication to gain approval that title goes to onpattro a medication approved in the us and eu in 2018 which treats nerve damagerna vaccines have several benefits over other vaccine types the most obvious is the pace at which we can make them covid19 vaccines are setting new records for the speed with which a vaccine has gone from development to approval synthetic rna is straightforward to make in a lab so it doesnt take long to design and produce these vaccines take moderna they finalised the rna sequence for their vaccine just two days after chinese scientists shared the genetic sequence of sarscov2 and they made the first clinical batch of the vaccine just 25 days after thisrna vaccines also have safety benefits the synthetic rna cant cause illness  though its a blueprint for virus spike protein production in our bodies cells production of this protein alone cant trigger an infection the rna itself gets broken down by normal processes in our cells so it doesnt hang around for long anywaytheres good evidence from the trials that these rna vaccines are effective in preventing covid19 modernas vaccine has shown 100% efficacy against severe disease and general efficacy of 941%  a higher figure than perhaps expected the pfizer/biontech vaccine has reported similarly impressive results of 95% efficacy this compares pretty well with vaccine efficacies for other diseases for example the average influenza vaccine effectiveness since 2010 is 42%like vaccinations for many diseases the rna vaccines for covid19 need two doses the bodys immune response when confronted with the coronavirus spike protein is to produce antibodies and memory cells this response helps the body respond quickly if it spots the virus multiple doses increase the quantities of memory cells created meaning a faster and more effective response if we encounter the virusits tempting to feel like the battle is won now that a vaccine has gained approval its an important step but the process of vaccinating enough of the population to stymy the spread of the virus will take time the uk has ordered enough of the pfizer/biontech vaccine to vaccinate 20 million people but with the current uk population standing at over 65 million well still need more doses or additional vaccines the ordered doses wont all arrive at once either  the first delivery of doses will only be enough for 400000 peoplestill the approval of a vaccine is positive news in a year thats contained far too little of it while boris johnsons suggestion in july that wed be back to normal by christmas now looks laughable (and to be honest looked laughable at the time too) having safe effective vaccines means that perhaps during 2021 we can gradually return to something a bit closer to prepandemic lifethis graphic was developed in partnership with the royal society of

217	1	The german company biontech partnered with pfizer to develop and test a coronavirus vaccine known as bnt162b2 a clinical trial demonstrated that the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 95 percent in preventing covid19a piece of coronavirusthe sarscov2 virus is studded with proteins that it uses to enter human cells these socalled spike proteins make a tempting target for potential vaccines and treatmentslike the moderna vaccine the pfizerbiontech vaccine is based on the viruss genetic instructions for building the spike proteinmrna inside an oily shellthe vaccine uses messenger rna genetic material that our cells read to make proteins the molecule called mrna for short is fragile and would be chopped to pieces by our natural enzymes if it were injected directly into the body to protect their vaccine pfizer and biontech wrap mrna in oily bubbles made of lipid nanoparticlesbecause of their fragility the mrna molecules will quickly fall apart at room temperature pfizer is building special containers with dry ice thermal sensors and gps trackers to ensure the vaccines can be transported at 70 celsius to stay viableentering a cellafter injection the vaccine particles bump into cells and fuse to them releasing mrna the cells molecules read its sequence and build spike proteins the mrna from the vaccine is eventually destroyed by the cell leaving no permanent tracesome of the spike proteins form spikes that migrate to the surface of the cell and stick out their tips the vaccinated cells also break up some of the proteins into fragments which they present on their surface these protruding spikes and spike protein fragments can then be recognised by the immune systemspotting the intruderwhen a vaccinated cell dies the debris will contain many spike proteins and protein fragments which can then be taken up by a type of immune cell called an antigenpresenting cellthe cell presents fragments of the spike protein on its surface when other cells called helper tcells detect these fragments the helper tcells can raise the alarm and help marshal other immune cells to fight the infectionmaking antibodiesother immune cells called bcells may bump into the coronavirus spikes and protein fragments on the surface of vaccinated cells a few of the bcells may be able to lock on to the spike proteins if these bcells are then activated by helper tcells they will start to proliferate and pour out antibodies that target the spike proteinstopping the virusthe antibodies can latch on to coronavirus spikes mark the virus for destruction and prevent infection by blocking the spikes from attaching to other cellskilling infected cellsthe antigenpresenting cells can also activate another type of immune cell called a killer tcell to seek out and destroy any coronavirusinfected cells that display the spike protein fragments on their surfacesremembering the virusthe pfizerbiontech vaccine requires two injections given 21 days apart to prime the immune system well enough to fight off coronavirus but because the vaccine is so new researchers dont know how long its protection might lasta preliminary study found that the vaccine seems to offer strong protection about 10 days after the first dose compared with people taking a placeboits possible that in the months after vaccination the number of antibodies and killer tcells will drop but the immune system also contains special cells called memory bcells and memory tcells that might retain information about the coronavirus for years or even decades																
218	1	How does a vaccine workvaccinations are our best protection against infections that in the past have killed many people when we receive a vaccine we become immune  or protected  from that specific infection because many of the germs that cause vaccinepreventable infections are still in our environment we need to stay up to date with vaccinations to remain protectedvaccines work by teaching your body to recognize specific dangerous pathogens so your immune system is prepared to fight off that infection in the future vaccines introduce small parts of germs that are weakened or dead collectively called antigens to our body these antigens act to trigger the bodys natural immune response but without causing illnesshow vaccines protect against pathogensin response to a vaccine antigen specialized immune system cells called t and b lymphocytes or t and b cells become activated so that if we are infected by the germ at a later time our bodys immune defence system will recognize the invaders and protect usvaccines then are much safer than developing immunity through being infected with a germbcells produce antibodies which are proteins that bind to antigens these antibodies tag the virus or bacteria and alert immune cells to their presence so they can be gobbled up and disposed of antibodies can also neutralize pathogens directly by binding to the antigens in a way that blocks their activity preventing them from making us sick tcells on the other hand attack and destroy infected cells in our body to stop the infection from spreading after a vaccine these memory cells stay circulating in the body making it easier for the body to fight off the live virus or bacteria if you are ever exposedvaccines also frequently contain additives called adjuvants to the vaccine itself that can help promote a stronger immune response making the vaccines more effective for a longer period of timenot all vaccines are the samethe immune systems response and memory can vary depending on the pathogen and the type of vaccine used which is why sometimes we need to get more than one dose of a vaccine or even get regular booster shots to remind our immune system of the organism some viruses like the flu change each year and annual differences in the type of virus circulating in the population require a new vaccine each time to protect against the most common strains for that seasonvaccines protect our community toowithin a community vaccines can create herd immunity not everyone has an immune system that can mount a proper immune response some people  particularly infants the elderly and the immunocompromised  cant get certain vaccines and are especially vulnerable to severe illness when theyre exposed to live pathogens if enough healthy people get vaccinated it makes it almost impossible for a disease outbreak to occur because the disease cant establish itself in enough hosts to spread through the population this protects the most vulnerable among us even if they cant get a vaccine themselvesthis is why doctors recommend staying up to date on your vaccinations including an annual flu shot to protect yourself and your loved ones from preventable illnesses																
219	1	Theres good news about coronavirus vaccines at least three of the experimental vaccines show remarkable efficacy at least according to information released by the makers in news releasesglobal vaccine giant astrazeneca reports its vaccine prevented coronavirus infection 62% of the time when people got two doses a month apart but in a subgroup of volunteers who got a half dose followed by a full dose a month later the vaccine appeared to be 90% effectivethat averages out to 70% efficacy the vaccines made by pfizer inc and biotechnology company moderna appear to protect against symptomatic infection 95% of the timepfizers and modernas vaccines use very similar technology while astrazeneca uses a different approach they are among six vaccines getting some kind of federal government support in the united states and dozens in development around the worldheres a look at the technology behind some of the candidates that are the furthest along in development  mostly in phase 3 clinical trials the last step before seeking the goahead from the us food and drug administration and other regulators around the worldpfizer and biontechpfizer and its germanbased partner biontech use a new approach to making vaccines that uses messenger rna or mrnapfizer and biontech apply for fda emergency use authorization for coronavirus vaccinepfizer and biontech apply for fda emergency use authorization for coronavirus vaccinethis design was chosen for a pandemic vaccine years ago because its one that lends itself to quick turnaround all that is needed is the genetic sequence of the virus causing the pandemic vaccine makers dont even need the virus itself  just the sequencein this case biontech researchers used a little piece of genetic material coding for a piece of the spike protein  the structure that adorns the surface of the coronavirus giving it that studded appearancemessenger rna is a single strand of the genetic code that cells can read and use to make a protein in the case of this vaccine the mrna instructs cells in the body to make the particular piece of the viruss spike protein then the immune system sees it recognizes it as foreign and is prepared to attack when actual infection occursmrna is very fragile so its encased in lipid nanoparticles  a coating of a buttery substance that can melt at room temperature thats why pfizers vaccine must be kept at ultracold temperatures of about minus 100 degrees f (minus 75 degrees c) that means special equipment is needed to transport and store this vaccinemoderna's coronavirus vaccine is 945% effective according to company datamodernas coronavirus vaccine is 945% effective according to company datamodernamodernas vaccine is also based on mrna mrna is like software for the cell moderna said on its websiteand like the pfizer/biontech vaccine it codes for cells to make a piece of the spike protein that was a careful choice  scientists had to pick a piece of the virus they thought would not mutate or change much as time passed the virus uses the spike protein to grapple the cells it attacks and the structure does appear to stay stable through generation after generation of viral replicationmoderna to apply today for fda authorization for its covid19 vaccinemoderna to apply today for fda authorization for its covid19 vaccinemoderna has come up with a different formulation for the lipid nanoparticles to protect the mrna in its vaccine these formulations are corporate secrets but moderna thinks its approach is better and said its vaccine can be shipped at minus 20 degrees c (minus 4 degrees f) and can be kept stable for 30 days at 2 degrees to 8 degrees c (36 to 46f) the temperature of a standard home refrigeratorastrazenecaastrazenecas vaccine made with a team at britains oxford university is called a vector vaccine it uses a common cold virus called an adenovirus to carry the spike protein from the coronavirus into cellsit also aims to make peoples bodies in essence produce their own vaccines by churning out little copies of spike protein but the delivery method is different this adenovirus infects chimpanzees but doesnt make people sick it was modified so that it doesnt replicate itself  then genetically engineered to inject cells with the dna encoding for the full coronavirus spike proteinits a cheaper way to make vaccines  but slower than using rna the company has pledged to make its vaccine available inexpensively to countries around the world the vaccine can be kept stable for six months at standard refrigerator temperatures the company

220	1	The bodys natural responsea pathogen is a bacterium virus parasite or fungus that can cause disease within the body each pathogen is made up of several subparts usually unique to that specific pathogen and the disease it causes the subpart of a pathogen that causes the formation of antibodies is called an antigen the antibodies produced in response to the pathogens antigen are an important part of the immune system you can consider antibodies as the soldiers in your bodys defense system each antibody or soldier in our system is trained to recognize one specific antigen we have thousands of different antibodies in our bodies when the human body is exposed to an antigen for the first time it takes time for the immune system to respond and produce antibodies specific to that antigenin the meantime the person is susceptible to becoming illonce the antigenspecific antibodies are produced they work with the rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen and stop the disease antibodies to one pathogen generally dont protect against another pathogen except when two pathogens are very similar to each other like cousins once the body produces antibodies in its primary response to an antigen it also creates antibodyproducing memory cells which remain alive even after the pathogen is defeated by the antibodies if the body is exposed to the same pathogen more than once the antibody response is much faster and more effective than the first time around because the memory cells are at the ready to pump out antibodies against that antigenthis means that if the person is exposed to the dangerous pathogen in the future their immune system will be able to respond immediately protecting against diseasevaccines antibody illustration 01_29 octhow vaccines helpvaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body newer vaccines contain the blueprint for producing antigens rather than the antigen itself regardless of whether the vaccine is made up of the antigen itself or the blueprint so that the body will produce the antigen this weakened version will not cause the disease in the person receiving the vaccine but it will prompt their immune system to respond much as it would have on its first reaction to the actual pathogenvaccines antibody illustration 02_29 octsome vaccines require multiple doses given weeks or months apart this is sometimes needed to allow for the production of longlived antibodies and development of memory cells in this way the body is trained to fight the specific diseasecausing organism building up memory of the pathogen so as to rapidly fight it if and when exposed in the futureherd immunitywhen someone is vaccinated they are very likely to be protected against the targeted disease but not everyone can be vaccinated people with underlying health conditions that weaken their immune systems (such as cancer or hiv) or who have severe allergies to some vaccine components may not be able to get vaccinated with certain vaccines these people can still be protected if they live in and amongst others who are vaccinated when a lot of people in a community are vaccinated the pathogen has a hard time circulating because most of the people it encounters are immune so the more that others are vaccinated the less likely people who are unable to be protected by vaccines are at risk of even being exposed to the harmful pathogens this is called herd immunitythis is especially important for those people who not only cant be vaccinated but may be more susceptible to the diseases we vaccinate against no single vaccine provides 100% protection and herd immunity does not provide full protection to those who cannot safely be vaccinated but with herd immunity these people will have substantial protection thanks to those around them being vaccinatedvaccinating not only protects yourself but also protects those in the community who are unable to be vaccinated if you are able to get vaccinatedherd1vaccines topic 1 illustrations 04throughout history humans have successfully developed vaccines for a number of lifethreatening diseases including meningitis tetanus measles and wild poliovirusin the early 1900s polio was a worldwide disease paralysing hundreds of thousands of people every year by 1950 two effective vaccines against the disease had been developed but vaccination in some parts of the world was still not common enough to stop the spread of polio particularly in africa in the 1980s a united worldwide effort to eradicate polio from the planet began over many years and several decades polio vaccination using routine immunization visits and mass vaccination campaigns has taken place in all continents millions of people mostly children have been vaccinated and in august 2020 the african continent was certified wild poliovirus free joining all other parts of the world except pakistan and afghanistan where polio has not yet been eradicated																
221	1	Amazingly not one but two covid19 vaccines  from pfizer and moderna respectively  are spilling out of the chute within days of each other the new vaccines work the same way but they differ somewhat from the conventional ones that have long protected us from measles yellow fever smallpox polio and many other infectious diseasesthey are the first vaccines ever approved for clinical use that employ an informationcoding molecule called rna to generate an immune response to a microbial pathogen this is revolutionary because what the immune system responds to is not the rna but something the rna teaches our cells to maketo understand the new vaccines magic consider how older vaccines detect defang and destroy invading bacterial and viral pathogenshow conventional vaccines workat the heart of every vaccine is a component called an antigen  typically a chunk of a protein thats identical to one borne by the targeted pathogen  that can excite the immune system to recognize it then rally and retaliate against itwhen a vaccine dose is shot into your arm it draws the attention of frontline immune sentinels called dendritic cells stanford medicine vaccine expert bali pulendran phd told me widely distributed throughout the bodys tissues (notably under the skin and in or near muscle tissue) dendritic cells sit around waiting for troubleas soon as these dendritic cells sense an antigen suggesting an invading pathogen is present they slurp it up chew it into little pieces display these tidbits on their surfaces like battle trophies and head for the lymph nodes the barracks of the immune systemthere they alert an assemblage of diverse immunecell types which launch a coordinated attack on anything possessing features identical to those antigenic battle trophieshow the new rnabased covid19 vaccines are differentso how are the new vaccines different instead of antigen payloads they carry copies of the recipe for making the antigen in the form of rna a molecule that stores informationfiguring out what microenvironment best preserves a proteinbased vaccines antigenicity then producing it in ultrapure form for clinical trials is a slow process but generating purified rna molecules that mimic a pathogens gene is a snap it took less than a year for an effective vaccine for sarscov2 the coronavirus that causes covid19 to be developed and gain food and drug administration emergency use approvallike its close cousin dna rna is a string of chemical units representing similarly to letters of the alphabet the genetic code that all living cells use as instructions for producing their component proteinsthe newly licensed covid19 vaccines contain myriad identical rna strands all coding for a critical section of the coronaviruss spike protein this protein is easy for the immune system to attack because it sits on the viruss outer surface its also indispensable to the virus as its absolutely required for entry into our cells so the virus doesnt have the option of altering its spike protein via mutation to escape immune detectionthe vaccines rna strands are hidden inside of nanoscale fat globules which keeps our immune systems from flipping out and going all medieval on our tissues (your immune system isnt used to seeing rna floating around outside of cells when it does its first hunch is that the outofplace genetic material belongs to a viral or bacterial pathogen and it may react aggressively and indiscriminately)the primary target for an rna vaccine as for traditional vaccines is dendritic cells which pulendran told me love to gobble up nanoscale droplets they shuttle the rnaladen fat globules through their outer membranes into the cytoplasm a cells factory floor once inside the rna strands make their way to proteinproducing power tools called ribosomes and perch on themthe ribosomes decipher the strands coded instructions and churn out new sarscov2 spikeprotein bits of incomparable purity by the bucketful  its like a cellular protein factory pulendran saiddendritic cells in the vicinity of the shot take up the antigencoding rna and can as a result produce tons of antigen on their own this triggers an effect similar to traditional vaccines in which dendritic cells displaying their antigenic trophies on their surfaces race to the lymph nodes to tip off the immune cells hanging out theredendritic cells newfound ability to brew up the sarscov2 antigen theyve produced by themselves may result in bits of chewedup antigen being displayed all the more abundantly on these cells surfaces this pulendran suggested could boost the immune response  and could help explain the effectiveness of both rnabased covid19 vaccinessome unknownsnonimmune cells such as those in muscle or nearby fat tissue  which wouldnt have ingested the antigens contained in traditional vaccines  can in principle take up rna but they do so far less efficiently than dendritic cellsif any nonimmune cells in the vicinity were to take up rna from the covid19 vaccine they too would produce the spike protein and they too would chew up a fraction of these newly produced protein pieces into little tidbits and display them on their surfaces for inspection by roving immune cells that survey our tissues for signs of intrudersthis pulendran said could amplify the antigens exposure to those patrolling inspectors on the lookout for invaded cells  for instance in the lung and upper respiratory tract where sarscov2 most likes to get a toehold this would further strengthen the immune responseimportantly the genes of cells that ingest vaccine rna arent altered the rna delivered by a vaccine needs only to get to the cytoplasm not to penetrate the cell nucleus  where the genes reside  to produce antigenic material even if the vaccine rna did get into the nucleus our cells are unable to convert rna into the dna our genes are made ofnor can the vaccine rna molecules taken up by our cells replicate themselves  our cells contain no capacity to perform that operationwhile the covid19 vaccines have been proven effective in preventing severe disease their ability to block disease transmission remains unknown but pulendran pointed out that caveat applies to most vaccines weve been routinely using for yearsanother unknown the durability of immunity the vaccines confer can only be assessed as the months and years roll bythe 19thcentury poet and philosopher ralph waldo emerson once called the opening volley of the american revolutionary war the shot that was heard around the worldthe revolutionary new rna vaccines may someday be recalled as the shots that cured around the world

224	1	According to company data drug maker moderna announced on nov 16 that during phase 3 of testing its covid19 vaccine is 945 percent effective this makes moderna the second company to report preliminary results with such a high success rate this news comes a week after pfizer in collaboration with biontech announced that their covid19 vaccine is over 90 perfect effectivethe moderna vaccine study enrolled more than 30000 us participants according to modernas press release it was a randomized 11 placebocontrolled study testing mrna1273 a type of messenger rna made of a synthetic version of coronavirus genetic material at the 100 g dose level according to cnn both pfizer and modernas vaccines use the same mrna technology to create their vaccines which is why theyre showing similar efficacy resultshalf of the moderna vaccine participants got two doses of the vaccine 28 days apart and half got two shots of a placebo on the same schedule among the study participants were 95 instances of covid19 illness  90 were in the group receiving the placebo and only five cases were in the vaccinated group of the 90 cases only 11 were severethere were no reported safety concerns regarding the vaccine and moderna stated that it seemed to be well tolerated some participants reported mild side effects including pain or redness at the injection site fatigue fever muscle and joint pain and headachesanthony fauci md director of the national institute of allergies and infectious diseases said in an interview on today that these results are very impressive and now we have two vaccines that are really quite effectivedr fauci projects that both pfizer and modernas vaccines should become available to highrisk individuals by december and to the general public by spring 2021 but warns that the virus is not going to stop and call a time out help is on the way which should encourage us even more to continue the necessary health precautions weve already been taking such as wearing masks social distancing and washing handsone issue brought up by the new york times is how long immunity will last with these two vaccines the moderna vaccine study also didnt include children additional concerns are the low temperatures in which both vaccines need to stored  minus four degrees fahrenheit for moderna and minus 94 fahrenheit for pfizer this makes distribution of the vaccines a little more difficult particularly to lowincome areas in hot climatesrelatedwhy we need a vaccine to achieve herd immunity for covid19experts explain why a vaccine is the only safe way to achieve herd immunity for covid19modernas vaccine will last 30 days in the refrigerator while pfizers only lasts five days according to cnn moderna added that their vaccine will last 12 hours at room temperature in the new york times article dr william schaffner an infectious disease expert at vanderbilt university said the relative ease of handling the moderna vaccine would give it a big advantage over pfizersboth pfizer and moderna said they expected to apply within weeks to the fda for emergency authorization to begin vaccinating the public moderna said it would have 20 million doses ready by the end of 2020 and pfizer said it would have about 50 million by then both vaccines require two shots so 20 million doses would be enough for 10 million people this news is certainly hopeful but as dr fauci recommended we should continue to do what we can to prevent the spread of the disease until these vaccines actually become available to everyone																
225	1	London  astrazeneca on monday became the third pharmaceutical company to announce positive results from latestage trials of a coronavirus vaccine saying that its candidate developed by oxford university was highly effectiveare you on telegram subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on russias war in ukrainescientists and politicians alike hailed the third straight week of buoyant scientific news as a sign that even as coronavirus cases surge to devastating levels in many countries an end to the pandemic is in sightthe astrazeneca candidate was 70 percent effective on average with up to 90 percent efficacy in a smaller group that got a lower dosage pfizer and its german partner biontech and moderna have each reported vaccines that were 95 percent effective in clinical trials different trial designs make direct comparison complicated but even with somewhat lower protection the astrazeneca vaccine may be a more realistic option for much of the world as it is likely to be less expensive and does not need to be stored at subzero temperaturespeter piot director of the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine who was instrumental in the battle against aids said the positive results from three vaccine candidates cannot be overestimatedhe said that 2020 will be remembered for the many lives lost from covid19 lockdowns and the us election science should now be added to this list he added that the only way to stop covid19 in its tracks is having multiple effective and safe vaccines that can be deployed all around the world and in vast quantitiesim totally delighted said hildegund cj ertl a vaccine expert at the wistar institute in philadelphia what it tells me is this virus can be beaten quite easily 90 to 95 percent efficacy is something wed dream about for influenza virus and wed never get itin years when the flu vaccine is a good match for the strain in circulation it ranges between 40 and 60 percent effectivecoronavirus vaccines are coming who should get them firstthe oxfordastrazeneca team said in a video conference with journalists that its candidate offered 90 percent protection against the coronavirus when a subject received half a dose followed with a full dose one month later efficacy was lower  62 percent  when subjects received two full doses a month apartandrew pollard chief investigator of the oxford trial said the findings showed that the vaccine would save many livesexcitingly weve found that one of our dosing regimens may be around 90 percent effective and if this dosing regimen is used more people could be vaccinated with planned vaccine supply he saidbritain has preordered 100 million doses  which at a dose and a half per person would cover most of its population the united states has ordered 300 million though both countries have hedged their bets and signed multiple vaccine dealsthe astrazeneca results have yet to be peerreviewed or published and outside scientists said that much depended on seeing those in detail many questions remain including why the lowerdose regimen was more effective it is also unclear whether the vaccine can reduce transmission of the coronavirus by people who have no symptoms which would have repercussions for how soon people could stop wearing masks no one yet knows how long immunity from the vaccine will lastsomeone in europe is dying every 17 seconds of covid19 who sayssarah gilbert a lead oxford researcher cautioned that the doseandahalf regimen would have to be studied more closely to be fully understood but she said that the first halfdose might be priming a persons immune system just enough and that the booster would then encourage the body to produce a robust defense against infectionastrazeneca and oxford have been conducting phase 3 clinical trials worldwide with the most recent data coming from an interim analysis based on 131 coronavirus infections in britain and brazil among nearly 23000 volunteers with half receiving the vaccine and half getting a placebosuzanne sunday participates in the astrazeneca vaccine trial at nyu langone health in new york (sarah blesener for the washington post)the company is expected to finetune its vaccine trial in the united states in the coming weeks (sarah blesener for the washington post)the company said it will present the results to britains healthcare products regulators immediately and will discuss its latest data with us regulators as soon as possible it is still only midway through its us clinical trial though and now wants to adjust the format to further assess the halfdose shot plus boosterbut michael kinch director of the center for research innovation in business at washington university in st louis said there needs to be more transparency about the findings he said the reliance on foreign data the lack of clarity about which dose should be considered by regulators and the fact the trial found the stronger 90 percent efficacy in a small subset of people  fewer than 3000 received the doseandahalf regimen  raised concernunder normal circumstances i would say this would not be looked at favorably kinch saidworld markets have rallied on optimistic vaccine news although astrazeneca shares were down monday on the london stock exchangetheir coronavirus vaccine candidate has made them billionaires this modest german turkish couple doesnt own a carbecause the vaccine is in production if approved the first 4 million doses could be ready in december and 40 million could be delivered in the first quarter of 2021 company executives said by the spring the company and its global partners in brazil india russia and the united states could be producing 100 million to 200 million doses a monthat a news conference monday evening british prime minister boris johnson said with a favorable wind we should be able to inoculate the vast majority of the people who need the most protection by easterjohnson  who had the virus in the spring and spent several days in an intensive care unit  told parliament on monday that vaccines are edging ever closer to liberating us from the virus demonstrating emphatically that this is not a pandemic without endno participants who received the vaccine developed severe cases of the coronavirus or required hospitalization astrazeneca said monday the drugmaker also said that no serious safety events were reported in connection with the vaccine which was typically well tolerated by participants regardless of their dosing levels or agesitaly is again seeing one of the worlds highest coronavirus death tolls but it no longer registers as a national tragedythe vaccine uses a harmless cold virus that typically infects chimpanzees to deliver to the bodys cells the genetic code of the spike protein that dots the outside of the coronavirus that teaches the bodys immune system to block the real virusalthough the reason the regimen with an initial halfdose worked better remains unclear ertl said that it could be related to the fact that the bodys immune system can develop a defense mechanism to block the harmless virus thats used to deliver the spike proteins code giving a smaller initial dose may lessen those defenses and make the vaccine more effectiveoxford university researchers process serum to produce a coronavirus vaccine with astrazeneca (john cairns/oxford university/epaefe/shutterstock)several other vaccines in latestage development use a similar technology harnessing a harmless virus to deliver a payload that will teach the immune system how to fight off the real thing  including a johnson & johnson vaccine a russian vaccine being developed by the gamaleya research institute and a vaccine made by cansino biologics in chinathe pfizer and moderna vaccines use messenger rna a new vaccine platform never approved in a medical product for peoplealthough the astrazeneca results indicate somewhat lower efficacy the vaccine can be stored and transported at normal refrigerated temperatures for up to six months that could make it significantly easier to distribute around the world than pfizers vaccine which must be stored at minus70 degrees celsius or modernas which is stable in refrigerated conditions for only 30 days and must be frozen at minus20 degrees celsius after thata vial a vaccine and hopes for slowing a pandemic  how a shot comes to begilbert and her team began developing the astrazeneca vaccine in a small laboratory at oxford on a shoestring budget the university kicked in $13 million and then chose astrazeneca as a manufacturing partnerwe wanted to ensure there wouldnt be any profiteering off the pandemic said louise richardson the universitys vice chancellor so that their vaccine would be widely distributed and wouldnt just be for the wealthy and the first worldthe scientists said that although it appeared to be a race or a competition among the frontrunning vaccine developers no one company could produce the millions of doses needed to end the pandemicwe dont have enough supply for the whole planet pollard said adding that the important message is that there are at least three highly effective safe vaccines that also appear to work well among the elderly and that they are produced using different technologies ensuring the quickest route to manufacture the billions of doses that will be neededpollard said that it is unclear why the different vaccines were producing different results and that he and the scientific community are awaiting full data from all the clinical trials he said different studies were also using different end points to describe efficacyat this moment we cant fully explain the differences pollard said its critical to understand what everyone is measuring

trialpfizer announced monday that its covid19 vaccine made with messenger rna has proven 90 percent effective in phase 3 clinical trials (photo reuters/dado ruvic)pfizer announced monday that its covid19 vaccine made with messenger rna has proven 90 percent effective in phase iii clinical trials (photo reuters/dado ruvic)the phase iii clinical trial involved approximately 44000 participants from the us argentina brazil and germany half of the participants were given a placebo the other half a twodose vaccine in total 94 individuals developed covid19 suggesting that at 28 days individuals given the vaccine were 90 percent immune to the viruswith nearly 10 million cases of covid19 in the us and more than 230000 deaths the news has been heavily praised by experts in a statement released by pfizer the company chairman and ceo dr albert bourla called it a great day for science and humanity suggesting that it brings the world one step closer to normalcywe are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records hospitals nearing overcapacity and economies struggling to reopen bourla said with todays news we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a muchneeded breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisisas reactions to the news continue heres what you need to knowninety percent efficacy is exceptionally highdr amesh adalja senior scholar at johns hopkins center for health security says the prevention level of the vaccine has come in much higher than vaccine experts and other scientists anticipated most of us in the field did not think that these firstgeneration vaccines would provide anywhere near that level of efficacy of preventing infection adalja tells yahoo life we thought their main value would be in preventing hospitalizations and deaths but we were thinking of maybe 50 to 60 percent efficacy so this is surprisinga 90 percent prevention rate is much higher than other common vaccines including the influenza vaccine which last year was 45 percent effective the number also far surpasses the 50 percent efficacy that the food and drug administration suggested as the cutoff for covid19 vaccine approval but dr gregory poland a renowned vaccinologist and head of the mayo clinics vaccine research group who is on the review board for several covid19 vaccines (but not pfizers) says mutations could influence the efficacywe dont know anything about the efficacy of this vaccine against mutated viruses and this is important poland says these vaccines allow your body to see one piece of the virus but what happens when that protein changesthe vaccine relies on messenger rna which has not been used in any previous vaccinespfizers vaccine along with many of the 11 leading candidates has been created with whats known as messenger rna in 2015 harvard researchers described this approach as a novel technology that could transform the vaccination worldpoland explains how it works this is the genetic code for one piece of the virus the spike protein so you literally construct the genetic code and inject it into muscle cells which uses our bodys machinery to translate that series of nucleic acids into a protein he says that protein gets displayed on the outside of our immune surveillance cells which see it recognize it as a foreign and mount an immune response against itmoderna another american drugmaker has also created a vaccine that relies on mrna and experts say this new data may bode well for the companys own candidate thats another question we want to ask is this a class effect of mrna adalja says we havent had an mrna vaccine for humans but it does raise questions about whether the other vaccines like modernas will have the same safety profilethe results came from an independent review board  but experts are urging americans not to jump to conclusionsthe analysis came from whats known as an independent data monitoring committee a group of scientists and other vaccine experts who are not affiliated with either pfizer or biontech adalja says the research should be taken seriously but that more data is needed you just have to temper your enthusiasm because we want to see the full data in a peerreviewed journal format in order to be able to completely determine what the efficacy level is and what the safety profile is he says everybody is going to jump on the press release and i think its right to be enthusiastic but we need to be anticipating a full analysispoland says while its tempting to assume that the news means a vaccine is imminent the results leave many critical questions unanswered this is encouraging but its a small sliver of results whose data weve actually not seen yet poland says vaccines require far more data over months to yearsthe 44000 participants in the study he says are likely not representative enough to provide information on specific key groups including those most vulnerable to the virus we know nothing about efficacy or safety in children pregnant women highly immunocompromised people older people or the hardesthit populations he says and you also have to remember these are results for the most part in a world wearing masks whats the efficacy when masks are off and were not distancing we dont knowno matter what a vaccine will likely still not be available for the general public until 2021although the news is an exciting step forward it doesnt necessarily change the projected timeline of a vaccine pfizer will reportedly file for fda approval in the next few weeks but will still be required to prove that that vaccine is safe in a statement released monday morning presidentelect joe biden expressed optimism but reiterated that more steps are needed before a vaccine will be readythis news follows a previously announced timeline by industry officials that forecast vaccine approval by late november biden said even if that is achieved and some americans are vaccinated by later this year it will be many more months before there is widespread vaccination in this countryadalja agrees i do think by the end of the year health care workers may have access to a vaccine like this one under emergency use he says but this vaccination program is something thats very likely to take well into 2021poland once again stresses that despite the good news we may be years away from fully understanding how well the vaccine works you dont know what you dont know he says maybe a hundred thousand

adults those studies must also include other groups at high risk including minorities and people with chronic health problemsand the agency has told companies that they must track half their participants for side effects for at least two months the time period when problems typically crop up pfizer expects to reach that milestone later this month but said monday that no serious safety

that we should really doff our hats they are the real heroesthe vaccine is based on an adenovirus which causes the common cold in chimpanzeesthe virus is modified so it cant cause disease in humans it also carries an extra gene from the coronavirusinside the human body the gene makes the spike protein that coats the shell of the coronavirus stimulating an immune response that protects against

232	1	Dec 17 2020  pfizer and moderna began shipping the first batches of covid19 vaccines in december capping months of anticipation development clinical trials and regulatory reviewsthe fda granted emergency use authorization for both vaccines deeming them safe and effectivewebmd went to the experts for answers to a dozen frequently asked questions about the vaccines heres what you need to knowhow safe is the covid19 vaccinepaul offit md a member of the fda advisory panel that recommended the vaccines use says rigorous clinical trials of the shot identified no safety concerns despite its spedup productionthese vaccines were subjected to large phase iii clinical trials says offit a vaccine expert at childrens hospital of philadelphia regarding safety there was an insistence by the fda that at least tens of thousands of people be observed for 2 months after the final dose to make sure that there were no  uncommon side effectshow do vaccines offer protection against covid19webmds chief medical officer john whyte md explains how vaccines offer protection against covid19share on facebookshare on twitteroffit says the fasttracking of the vaccine was mostly a result of the upfront financing the federal government provided so no shortcuts were taken in verifying its safetythe government essentially paid for overlapping phenomena which is to say the vaccines were massproduced without knowing if they worked or were safe yet so they overlapped the phase iii trials with the mass production which would never normally happen he saysgigi gronvall md an immunologist and infectious disease specialist with the johns hopkins center for health security agrees and says the vaccine still underwent all of the safety checks involved in any clinical trialit has been tested as other vaccines and drugs have been there were no things done differently but the financial part made things happen faster says gronvall an associate professor at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public healthhow concerned should we be about adverse reactions being reportedthe cdc has reported 21 cases of anaphylaxis in people who received the pfizer vaccine and 10 cases in people who received the moderna vaccine in california state officials rescinded a temporary pause on some of their moderna vaccinations after several people received medical treatment for potential severe allergic reactionsstate officials said they found no evidence of a problem with a specific lot of modernas vaccinesevere cases are rarelast december british regulators concerns about such risks after two uk health care workers had allergic reactions to the pfizer vaccineas a result british health authorities say they will continue to investigate the two cases and monitor the vaccination program for other cases but they also say that serious reactions to the vaccine are very rareduring a meeting of an fda advisory panel in december experts pressed company officials on the question of allergic reactions in light of the british casesboth pfizer and moderna officials say there were no cases of serious allergic reactions in their clinical trialsthe fda panel decided against recommending that people with a history of allergic reactions to vaccines avoid the vaccines  a position later echoed by the cdc but the cdc does recommend that they talk to their doctor firstbut in greenlighting the vaccine the fda is requiring the companies increase monitoring for allergic reactions and submit followup dataoffit says followup studies of the vaccines safety will put to rest any lingering concernsthe benefits of that vaccine far outweigh what now are just considered to be theoretical risks he sayshe also says the british authorities stance on potential allergic reactions and overreaction could needlessly scare many people away from a desperately needed vaccine in the middle of a raging pandemicscientists investigating the reactions say the culprit may be the compound polyethylene glycol (peg) which is part of the fatty envelope that surrounds the mrna the main ingredient in the vaccinein addition four cases of bells palsy a type of temporary facial paralysis were reported in people who received the vaccine this is not more than would be expected in the general population howevershould you get the vaccine if you had reactions to vaccines medicines or foods in the pastit dependsthe cdc says that if you have a history of allergic reactions not related to vaccines  things like foods pets or latex  then its ok to get the covid vaccineif youve have any type of allergic reaction before to vaccines or injectable drugs you can still get the pfizer vaccine for covid19 but discuss the risks with your doctors and make sure to be monitored for 30 minutes after getting the shotif youve ever had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in the covid vaccines you should not get either of them the cdc saysit has been tested as other vaccines and drugs have been there were no things done differently but the financial part made things happen fastergigi gronvall md infectious disease specialist johns hopkins center for health securitygronvall says any adverse reactions will be monitored as the vaccine rolls out nationwide she says followup research should help dispel concerns about rare allergic reactions among some people who use epipens  devices that inject the drug epinephrine to counteract a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxisi have already seen it  that people who carry epipens are concerned about whether they should get the vaccine she says but this is data that the companies have indicated [some] of the people who participated in the clinical trials  were people who carry epipenson balance theres not a restriction here for people who have allergies and i would say the risks of covid19 are pretty high right now gronvall saysoffit says anaphylactic reactions to vaccines are rare and easily treatable with epinephrine that makes them much easier to manage than a severe case of covid19youre always asked to wait around after a vaccine for 15 minutes because about one out of every million people who get a vaccine can have a severe allergic reaction he says the only difference here is if you have had a severe allergic reaction in the past to an injectable medical product then you wait around for 30 minutes instead of 15offit says theres no reason for concern for people with allergies to foods beestings or other medicines noting studies have found many people who have allergies have received multiple vaccines without problemswhat should you do if you have an allergic reaction to the vaccineif you experience a severe allergic to the vaccine that requires medical treatment such as getting treated with epinephrine the cdc says you should not get a second dose of either of the currently available vaccines the same is true if you have an allergic reaction such as hives or swelling that does not need medical treatment do not get a second dosecan the vaccine cause other side effectsyes the fda says common side effects in pfizers clinical trial involving some 44000 people included pain where they got the shot fatigue headache chills fever and joint and muscle pain but these are all described as temporarythe symptoms were generally mild or moderate and happened more frequently after the second dosemoderna reported similar side effects in its trial of more than 30000 people participants most commonly reported pain at the injection site fatigue headache muscle pain joint pain and chillspeople should also know that less serious adverse reactions  side effects  are pretty common with this vaccine so its not going to be like the flu shot where you might just have a sore arm gronvall saysfor a lot of people theyll be pretty tired they might have a small fever and they can have headaches and all of these reactions are normal and thats the result of your body getting ready to be able to fight off covidwhy are side effects worse on the second dose of the vaccineit does appear that people have more effects after the second dose than the first gronvall says the reason is  as the vaccine gets your body ready to fight the disease some of the things your body does to fight the virus makes you feel a little under the weatherthats because the vaccine is like a training program for your immune system a lot of what your body does  the [immune system] cells that are stimulated the antibody production thats underway  all that stuff can make you feel  not so great for a day or 2although these side effects can be unpleasant they are temporary and an indication the vaccine is workingso people should know that and  not feel that theres something wrong gronvall says thats my concern  that people will be surprisedone other thing older people tend to have fewer side effects than people in the 18to55 range possibly because  younger people have more active immune systems she sayshow effective is the vaccinein pfizers large clinical trial the two doses of the vaccine were shown to be 95% effective at preventing covid19 cases according to results published in the new england journal of medicine two doses of modernas vaccine were shown to be 941% effectivethats more than twice the effectiveness of the annual flu shot which typically carries a 40% efficacy rateare there risks associated with vaccines made from genetic material called mrnanot at all the experts sayheres why the pfizer vaccine uses a snippet of genetic material called messenger rna  mrna for short  that doesnt contain the virus itself but rather a genetic code associated with the coronavirus that triggers the bodys immune response to fight itas the vaccine gets your body ready to fight the disease some of the things your body does to fight the virus makes you feel a little under the weathergigi gronvall md infectious disease specialist johns hopkins center for health securitythe mrna essentially teaches human cells to make something resembling the socalled spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus this prompts the bodys natural defenses to destroy it if the vaccinated person is later exposed to the real viruspart of what makes mrna so delicate and difficult to [use] logistically  requiring these ultracold conditions  is that its pretty delicate gronvall says so once it gets into your cells protein is made from it and then the mrna degrades pretty rapidlythe cdc has says mrna vaccines are relatively new but have been around for years and found to be safe the covid19 vaccine for instance cannot give someone the virus and cannot affect or interact with our dna or change our genes in any waythe covid19 mrna  vaccines are being held to the same rigorous safety and effectiveness standards as all other types of vaccines in the united states according to an online cdc explainera second covid19 vaccine made by moderna also uses mrna and has received fda approval the first doses of the vaccine which contains peg began dec 21 a doctor in boston experienced a severe allergic reaction after receiving the moderna vaccine on christmas eve the doctor is also allergic to shellfish and brought his own epipen to the vaccination and he recovered quickly after using it it is the first known severe reaction to the moderna vaccineten other vaccines are also now in latestage trials across the globe using various other methodsresearchers have been studying and working with mrna vaccines for decades  for flu zika rabies and cytomegalovirus (cmv) cancer researchers have also used mrna to trigger the immune system to target specific tumor cellsdoes the vaccine pose any special concern regarding autoimmune disordersin a word nogronvall says there is no scientific evidence that mrna can lead to immune system disorders or autoimmune diseasesthere are a range of syndromes even if theyre very rare that different sentinel [tracking] systems are looking for to see if there are any added risks for the vaccines and those systems will be going on for years she saysbut as of now the data doesnt say that an autoimmune risk is something that we need to be concerned aboutshe adds that the vaccine is safe for people who have autoimmune disorders or those who are being treated with other immunotherapies  for allergies cancer arthritis or other conditionsthere are no contraindications at this point for people with those conditions she saysbetty diamond md an immunologist and rheumatologist at the feinstein institutes for medical research of northwell health agrees that theres no evidence that mrna vaccines cause autoimmune disease or may cause problems for people with such conditionsat the moment theres every reason to suggest that people with autoimmune diseases ought to get either of these vaccines when they get rolled out she sayswhat about potential longterm side effectsoffit says there is no evidence that the pfizer vaccine can cause longterm side effects noting that most would have likely appeared during the pfizer studybut he says the followup studies will be keeping a close eye out for that possibilityi cant name you a long term side effect he says vaccines can cause serious rare side effects  thats true but that all occurs within 6 weeks of a dosehow is the government going to track potential side effectsthe fda and cdc have created several programs for tracking any reactions to the vaccinehealth authorities are encouraging anyone who has a bad reaction to the vaccine to file a report with the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) or call 8008227967this national system collects and analyzes such reports to help federal health authorities monitor the safety of vaccineshealth care professionals are also required to track and report reactions to the vaccine under the fdas emergency use authorization of the shotin addition cdc officials are using a new smartphonebased tool called vsafe to check in on people after they get the vaccine if you enroll in the vsafe program you will receive text messages directing you to surveys to report any problems or adverse reactionsseveral other cdc and fda programs are designed to monitor acutecare centers longterm care facilities and large health insurance databasesgronvall says these programs should provide more reassurance over time that the vaccine is safe and effectivepeople should know that there is a system in place to capture this data  to figure out if any problem people have is because of the vaccine she says so theres going to be a lot of data to help people feel less concerned about itwhat dont we know about the vaccinesit is still unclear if the vaccine makes you less contagious to others if you contracted the virus before getting the shot and/or are asymptomaticthere are going to be studies that are planned on that hopefully those studies will be done early next year and then well know more offit saysthe fda also says its unclear whether the vaccine is effective and safe for children younger than 16in addition more information is needed to determine how long the vaccines protection lasts and whether youll need to get one annually like the flu shotresearchers also need to know more about the safety and effectiveness in pregnant and breastfeeding women gronvall saysthats the biggest areas where we need to gather more data  in pregnant women she says they will need to be enrolled in clinical trials to be able to study them more carefully even though the guidance was that they are not prohibited from getting the vaccineoffit agrees noting pregnant women were included in the vaccine trialright now the cdc currently says if you are pregnant you may still get this vaccine if youre breastfeeding you may still get this vaccine he says but there were about two dozen women in the pfizer trial  who were pregnant at the time and the vaccine there was no untoward effect on the pregnancyso can we stop wearing masks nownope not yetuntil scientists can determine if the vaccine makes you less contagious to others we all still need to mask up keep our distance from others wash our hands often and use other smart prevention

234	1	A vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (covid19) is perhaps the best hope for ending the pandemic a number of biopharmaceutical companies have applied for us food and drug administration (fda) emergency use authorization for a new covid19 vaccine and a limited number of vaccines will be available before the end of the yearit is likely that you have heard claims about the covid19 vaccine on social media or from people in your life the quick development and approval of a vaccine may increase your hesitancy about its safety or effectiveness lets set the record straight on circulating myths about the covid19 vaccinemyth the covid19 vaccine is not safe because it was rapidly developed and testedfact many pharmaceutical companies invested significant resources into quickly developing a vaccine for covid19 because of the worldwide impact of the pandemic the emergency situation warranted an emergency response but that does not mean that companies bypassed safety protocols or didnt perform adequate testingmayo clinic will recommend the use of those vaccines that we are confident are safe while there are many covid19 vaccine candidates in development early interim data are encouraging for the pfizer vaccine which likely is to be the first authorized for emergency use by the fda in the late december/early january timeframe this vaccine was created using a novel technology based on the molecular structure of the virus the novel methodology to develop a covid19 vaccine allows it to be free from materials of animal origin and synthesized by an efficient cellfree process without preservatives this vaccine developed by pfizer/biontech has been studied in approximately 43000 peopleto receive emergency use authorization the biopharmaceutical manufacturer must have followed at least half of the study participants for at least two months after completing the vaccination series and the vaccine must be proven safe and effective in that population in addition to the safety review by the fda the advisory committee on immunization has convened a panel of vaccine safety experts to independently evaluate the safety data from the clinical trial mayo clinic vaccine experts also will review the available data the safety of covid19 vaccine will continue to be closely monitored by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and the fdamyth i already had covid19 and recovered so i dont need to get a covid19 vaccine when its availablefact there is not enough information currently available to say if or for how long after infection someone is protected from getting covid19 again this is called natural immunity early evidence suggests natural immunity from covid19 may not last very long but more studies are needed to better understand this mayo clinic recommends getting the covid19 vaccine even if youve had covid19 previously however those that had covid19 should delay vaccination until about 90 days from diagnosis people should not get vaccinated if in quarantine after exposure or if they have covid19 symptomsmyth there are severe side effects of the covid19 vaccinesfact there are shortterm mild or moderate vaccine reactions that resolve without complication or injury the early phase studies of the pfizer vaccine show that it is safe about 15% of people developed short lived symptoms at the site of the injection 50% developed systemic reactions primarily headache chills fatigue or muscle pain or fever lasting for a day or two keep in mind that these side effects are indicators that your immune system is responding to the vaccine and are common when receiving vaccinesmyth i wont need to wear a mask after i get the covid19 vaccinefact it may take time for everyone who wants a covid19 vaccination to get one also while the vaccine may prevent you from getting sick it is unknown at this time if you can still carry and transmit the virus to others until more is understood about how well the vaccine works continuing with precautions such as maskwearing and physical distancing will be importantmyth more people will die as a result of a negative side effect to the covid19 vaccine than would actually die from the virusfact circulating on social media is the claim that covid19s mortality rate is 1%2% and that people should not be vaccinated against a virus with a high survival rate however a 1% mortality rate is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu in addition the mortality rate can vary widely and is influenced by age sex and underlying health conditionwhile some people that receive the vaccine may develop symptoms as their immune system responds remember that this is common when receiving any vaccine and not considered serious or lifethreatening you cannot get covid19 infection from the covid19 vaccines they are inactivated vaccines and not live virusesits important to recognize that getting the vaccine is not just about survival from covid19 its about preventing spread of the virus to others and preventing infection that can lead to longterm negative health effects while no vaccine is 100% effective they are far better than not getting a vaccine the benefits certainly outweigh the risks in healthy peoplemyth the covid19 vaccine was developed as a way to control the general population either through microchip tracking or nano transducers in our brainsfact there is no vaccine microchip and the vaccine will not track people or gather personal information into a database this myth started after comments made by bill gates from the gates foundation about a digital certificate of vaccine records the technology he was referencing is not a microchip has not been implemented in any manner and is not tied to the development testing or distribution of the covid19 vaccinemyth the covid19 vaccine will alter my dnafact the first covid19 vaccines to reach the market are likely to be messenger rna (mrna) vaccines according to the cdc mrna vaccines work by instructing cells in the body how to make a protein that triggers an immune response injecting mrna into your body will not interact or do anything to the dna of your cells human cells break down and get rid of the mrna soon after they have finished using the instructionsmyth covid19 vaccines were developed using fetal tissuefact neither the pfizer/biontech covid19 vaccine nor the moderna covid19 vaccines contain fetal cells nor were fetal cells used in the development or production of either vaccinemyth covid19 vaccines cause infertility or miscarriagefact no covid19 vaccines have not been linked to infertility or miscarriagea sophisticated disinformation campaign has been circulating online claiming that antibodies to the spike protein of covid19 produced from these vaccines will bind to placental proteins and prevent pregnancy this disinformation is thought to originate from internet postings by a former scientist known to hold antivaccine viewsthese postings are not scientifically plausible as covid19 infection has not been linked to infertility also no other viral infection or vaccinationinducing immunity by similar mechanisms has been shown to cause infertility antibodies to the spike protein have not been linked to infertility after covid19 infection there is no scientific reason to believe this will change after vaccination for covid19while there are no formal studies the best evidence comes from women who got sick with covid19 while pregnant while data clearly indicate pregnant women are at higher risk of hospitalization due to covid19 infection there is no evidence of increased miscarriage ratesduring natural infection the immune system generates the same antibodies to the spike protein that covid19 vaccines would thus if covid19 affected fertility there already would be an increase in miscarriage rates in women infected with covid19 this has not happenedmyth i am allergic to eggs so i shouldnt get the covid19 vaccinefact neither the pfizer/biontech covid19 vaccine nor the moderna covid19 vaccines contain egg nor were eggs used the development or production of either vaccine however those with severe allergic reactions to eggs or any other substance (ie anaphylaxis) are encouraged to remain after vaccination for 30 minutes for observationmyth covid19 vaccines must be stored at extremely low temperatures because of preservatives in the vaccinesfact pfizer/biontech and moderna have reported that their vaccines contain no preservativesdifferent vaccines have different storage requirements for instance the pfizer/biontech vaccine must be stored at minus 94 degrees fahrenheit (minus 70 degrees celsius) while moderna has said that its vaccine needs to be stored at minus 4 degrees fahrenheit (minus 20 degrees celsius) both of these vaccines use messenger rna or mrna to teach your cells how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response to covid19 however messenger rna is fragile and can break down easily storing messenger rna vaccines like these covid19 vaccines in an ultracold environment keeps them stable and safeyou should not worry about these temperatures vaccines are thawed before injectionrelated informationmayo clinic q&a podcast how messenger rna vaccines work

connie price md said that she has no hesitancy about getting a covid19 vaccine and points to the race in development to beat the spread of the virus as a good thingwe needed to utilize technologies that could rapidly develop a new vaccine within a reasonable time period dr price said it was a race between developing a vaccine and a race between the covid vaccine infecting all of us and id like to say that we can win the rest of this battle thanks to the technology we were able to accelerate the developmentanuj mehta md is a denver health pulmonary and critical care physician and advisor to colorado governor jared polis on the covid19 vaccine he agrees with dr price about his willingness to get vaccinated as welltheyve been through really rigorous clinical trials he said adding that the volunteers who took part in those trials were equally represented when it comes to age gender race ethnicity and certain medical conditions such as obesity diabetes and lung disease the vaccine is proven and equally safe across all of those populationscan pregnant women breastfeeding mothers and immunocompromised get a covid19 vaccinethe centers for disease control and prevention is now recommending that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers get a covid19 vaccine to protect against the spread of the virus people who are immunocompromised should talk to their provider about whether they should get the vaccine so they can make an informed decision on whether the covid19 vaccine is right for them the centers for disease control and prevention will continue to update its guidelines

as well and is available at denver health all three vaccines are safe and proven effective in preventing hospitalizations from covid19the way we know that any medication works is by doing rigorous randomized controlled clinical trials  and thats what all covid vaccines are going through said dr mehtawhat is not known yet is whether this will be an annual vaccination so far those in the clinical trials have shown recipients of the vaccines have maintained good immunity to covid19 more than six months after getting itwhy should i get a covid19 vaccinethe covid19 vaccines will be critical in helping to prevent further infection or spread of covid19 amongst people in our community both drs mehta and price agree that it comes down to both protecting yourself and protecting your community by getting a vaccinethe vaccines are really critical to reopening the economy getting businesses going and reopening schools dr mehta addedcovid19 vaccines and communities of colordr mehta understands the hesitancy and potential distrust in these new vaccines among communities of color including latinx black and indigenous people he points to the clinical trials done by the vaccine manufacturers in partnership with the us government that included a large number of individuals from varied backgroundsthis was done specifically to try and address some of these concerns and history of not including communities of color in research and i think that what theyve done is by creating a very diverse population in our clinical trials we can speak very specifically about the safety in these different populations so specifically for communities of color there is evidence that the vaccine is just as safe and just as effective as it is for everybody elseside effects of the covid19 vaccinesin about a third of people who get the vaccine youll experience a reaction and thats because the vaccine is doing what we want it to do which is to produce an immune response said dr priceshe said that common reactions to the vaccine includearm sorenessfeverheadachemuscle achesthose symptoms may mimic a mild form of covid19 or the flu but dr price said it is not something to be concerned about and that it just reflects the fact that the vaccine is workingdr mehta agrees so just because the side effects are similar to the illness does not mean youre going to get covid from the vaccine it is actually impossible to catch covid19 from the covid19 vaccinethere is no evidence in any of the clinical trials that someone is going to get seriously ill or die from getting a covid19 vaccinecan children get

side effects youll want to have some time to recoverthe mild or moderate symptoms should go away within 2448 hours but if for some reason they do not dr price said you should contact your doctorcan i get a covid19 vaccine if i have allergiesthere have been news reports about some people with allergies having strong reactions to covid19 vaccines dr mehta wants patients to know that anything foreign that is put into your body can cause you to have an allergic reaction the cdc suggests that if you have ever had a serious allergic reaction (such as the throat closing up) to an injectable medication it is best to wait until there is more information and discuss with your doctor when is the best time to receive a covid19 vaccinefor the rest of us with mild allergic reactions to drugs and food he offers this advice anybody thats had kind of itching with penicillin or a sulfa drug or has a food allergy to eggs or something should feel safe to get the vaccine everybody needs to be monitored after they get the vaccine for a certain amount of time and people that have had a serious allergic reaction to say a food may want to be monitored for a little bit longer he adds that anyone who has had an allergic reaction was treated for it without having to be hospitalized and has recoveredshould i get a covid19 vaccine if i have had covid19denver healths medical experts advise anyone who has had covid19 within the past 90 days to consider deferring getting a covid19 vaccine thats because you still have some immunity said dr price you may be able to step aside and allow someone who hasnt had covid19 in the last 90 days to get that vaccine first after 90 days your immunity may be waning and the benefit of the vaccine may be greater for youwill covid19 vaccines stop the fludenver health is encouraging everyone to get both a flu vaccine and a covid19 vaccine when it is availablethe covid19 vaccine unfortunately cannot stop the flu said dr price you have to get an influenza vaccine separately and viceversa the flu vaccine will not stop covid19find out more about getting your flu vaccine during the covid19 pandemicdoes the arrival of covid19 vaccines mean can we go back to normalyou should not stop wearing masks and social distancing in public now that the covid19 vaccine is here and even after you get the vaccine we still have to do those things until we can ensure that the community has herd immunity and that this virus isnt circulating anymore said dr price herd immunity refers to a percentage of the population that needs to be immune to covid19 to be able to stop it from infecting other people in the community who are not immuneaccording to the cdc you are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the final dose of a twodose vaccine or two weeks after a onedose vaccine once you are fully vaccinated you can safely gather indoors without face coverings with others who are fully vaccinated or with unvaccinated people from just one other householdone day we will be able to get back to normal but it wont be immediate i see this as the final tool in our toolbox  we have masking we have social distancing and now we have a vaccine i see a way out of this pandemic said dr pricedr mehta agrees calling the vaccines a home run

240	1	There are over a hundred vaccines against sarscov2 in development including at least 54 vaccines currently being tested on human subjects [1] many biotechnological companies and partnerships are involved collaborating and competing against each other to develop and produce effective and safe vaccines as the promise of restoring business activities and freedom of movement fuels our attention to the vaccine race there are several economic questions that remain unansweredwhat is the economic value of vaccines against sarscov2what will influence the price of the vaccineswhat other costs for vaccine rollout should be consideredwhat financing mechanisms are in place to cover those costswhat is the economic value of vaccines against sarscov2to estimate the economic value of a preventive measure economists typically assess the costs associated with the disease prevented most often those costs consist of the average medical and nonmedical costs incurred by an individual the health system or society including insurance reimbursement payments and outofpocket payments for items such as diagnostic tests medications hospitalization and transportation to and from healthcare facilities these costs also include indirect costs due to productivity loss such as lost wages due to illness disability or premature death the classic approach to assessing costofillness assumes that the total cost is encompassed by these medical and nonmedical costs yet these estimates may undervalue the broader economic impact on society [2]the considerable economic and social toll caused by the covid19 pandemic however extends well beyond direct health costs in addition to costs incurred due to covid19 itself medical and health system accrue additional costs due to delayed elective procedures forgone routine preventive health services (eg vaccination and cancer screenings) during lockdown periods reduced ability to treat patients due to overcrowding of healthcare facilities with covid19 cases and delays in careseeking by individuals fearful of covid19in addition to health sector costs the necessary business restrictions and lockdowns used as preventive measures  and resulting changes to consumer behavior  expanded the productivity loss beyond the health system and those infected as such economists cannot resort to traditional costeffectiveness or costofillness analysis as many of the benefits of preventing or treating covid19 are not healthrelated to assess these broader impacts requires economists to forecast economic recovery as well as predict where the global economy would be in the absence of covid19in addition to quantifying the economic value of returning to normalcy for business activities other nonhealth benefits are known to economists and a few can be quantified and costed based on a report from the professional society for health economics and outcomes research (ispor) garrison jr et al and kamalbahl et al suggested consideration of additional types of nonhealthrelated costs [35]nonhealth costs	there is value in	referencefear of contagion	reducing the fear of contagion in a pandemic and alleviating concerns attached to the freedom of movement and to congregate	[4]severity of disease	avoiding getting sick from a potentially lethal or debilitating disease	[4]insurance value	reducing a persons physical and financial risk in this pandemic	[4 5]reduction in uncertainty	increasing the value of knowing and limiting the uncertainty by reducing the probability of disability or death	[4 5]value of hope	increasing a patients value of the vaccine beyond the average gain in qualityadjusted life years (qaly)	[4 5]scientific spillovers	increasing the scientific knowledge in vaccine development and rollout and disease prevention thus paving the way for more effective vaccines and vaccine rollouts	[4 5]equity	reducing the risk associated with the disease in vulnerable populations and in populations most affected by it	[4]equity while missing from many economic analyses is important to consider when rolling out covid19 vaccines as deviations from perceived or explicit fairness may result in backlash and future hesitancy the plan outlined by the united states national academies of sciences engineering and medicine prioritizes vaccine allocation for first responders highrisk health workers and vulnerable populations in the united states since the first vaccine (pfizerbiontech) received emergency use authorization on december 11 2020 over three million doses were distributed to healthcare facilities in all 50 states [6] it is worth noting that the vaccine rollout is not managed centrally in the united states but by each state each states prioritization may differ from the national academies recommendationsgiven the impact of covid19 on health systems across the globe  one of the largest disruptions to economic activity in modern history  the broader benefits of vaccines against sarscov2 along with reducing the need or intensity of future lockdowns and restrictions most likely far outweigh the expected costs of vaccination globally [7]what will influence the price of the vaccinesthe price of vaccine doses is driven by two costs the cost of research and development (r&d) and the cost of production and manufacturinga vaccines r&d costs can be hard to quantify as they include the cost of unsuccessful candidates and profits foregone [8] medications and other treatments included only 001002% of compounds screened are ultimately fdaapproved for sale [9] r&d cost is also influenced by startup production clinical trials and regulatory processes [810] traditionally r&d often has high sunk costs as most research facilities are vaccinespecific and there often exists a long lag time between production and sales to produce novel vaccines the r&d cost may be higher than for established vaccines new and technologically advanced vaccines often have higher production costs and are likely to be on the market for shorter time periods as they may be quickly replaced by combination vaccines [10] this said the advanced market commitment  a legallybinding agreement for an amount of funds to subsidize the purchase at a given price of an as yet unavailable vaccine against a specific disease causing high morbidity and mortality in developing countries [11]  and overall interest in covid19 vaccines will likely shorten any delay between production and salesmanufacturing is a large part of the vaccine cost structure costs associated with administration quality control depreciation and other fixed costs account for 60% of the total vaccine manufacturing cost [12] the manufacturing cost can be very high if the manufacturer does not have operational facilities in place this production cost is influenced by vaccine type time unaccountable obstacles and other simultaneous product development and production [8] to date the us government alone has spent over $9 billion usd for the development of covid19 vaccines with an additional $200m for vaccine preparedness [13 14]therefore the price of the vaccine often entails high sunk costs and high fixed costs with low marginal cost per dose nevertheless in the case of sarscov2 vaccine production governments bilateral and multilateral organizations nongovernmental organizations (ngos) and private companies are funding vaccine r&d and have signed contracts with vaccine manufacturers prior to vaccine approval this increases incentives in producing the vaccines and lowers the risk of capital loss [15 16]several laboratories developing vaccines against sarscov2 are partnering with vaccine manufacturers to ease the transition from development to production (eg the oxford university and astrazeneca partnership and the nihmoderna partnership) such partnerships allow phases ii and iii of clinical trials to occur while simultaneously building up production capacity leading to a quicker rollout if the vaccine is approvedwhat other costs for vaccine rollout should be consideredvaccine costs include more than just the price of vaccine supplies the rollout costs for vaccines also include labor cold chain storage transportation capital and other recurrent costs including program management training social mobilization waste management and monitoring and evaluation [17] these costs are considered immunization delivery costs based on the international vaccine access centers recent study on childhood immunization program costing delivery costs account for nearly half of the total immunization program costs globally [17] delivery cost varies across regions ranging from $018 to $1131 per dose delivered depending on accessibility and countries infrastructure [17] to minimize delivery costs and ensure efficient and equitable access to sarcov2 vaccines governments need to leverage the strength of existing delivery infrastructure and integrate partnerships at all levelsthe key challenge awaiting the rollout of vaccines against sarscov2 is that unlike most vaccines that target children these vaccines will target adults  a larger and more difficult population to target effectively most countries lack the health system infrastructure or protocols to systematically administer vaccines to adults particularly in hardertoreach areas that are further from tertiary healthcare facilities this is especially the case in low and middleincome countries where few policies exist for adult vaccines already on the market and adult vaccination in the private sector is less common in addition increased vaccine hesitancy and lack of vaccine confidence will hamper efforts to vaccinate large populations even during a public health crisis [1820] this leads to higher wastage rates and costlier efforts in social mobilization through health communications and community engagementdifferent sarscov2 vaccines may have different requirements for storage and delivery and procuring highly specialized equipment may be necessary for instance the biotechnology used for the mrna vaccine developed by pfizer requires storage at minus 70 degrees celsius much colder than vaccines routinely used for childhood immunization [21] extreme cold chain requirements do not necessarily preclude low and middleincome countries from using such a vaccine several african countries used ultracold refrigerators to store and deliver the ebola vaccine in the past decade however countries without this infrastructure may opt to wait for a product with less stringent cold chain requirementsthe high wastage rates associated with such a largescale operation could be an opportunity for several companies to offer new injection technologies for instance apiject systems developed an injection platform to replace the glass vials currently used to transport and store vaccine doses aiming to significantly reduce any wastage at the time of vaccination [22] the company has applied for us food and drug administration approvalwhat financing mechanisms are in place to cover those costsmultiple highincome country governments have signed contracts and developed partnerships with r&d and manufacturing companies to cover procurement costs and secure covid19 vaccines once released including the us china canada japan and australia [23] to ensure equitable and affordable access for all countries international initiatives addressing public financing for covid19 vaccines are essential the gavi amc for covid19 vaccines (covax) convened by the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations gavi and the world health organization (who) has created the worlds largest and most diverse covid19 vaccine portfolio to accelerate affordable access to covid19 vaccines [24] covax is one of the three pillars of the access to covid19 tools accelerator (actaccelerator) a global collaboration between the bill & melinda gates foundation cepi gavi the global fund unitaid wellcome trust the who and the world bank [25]covax uses financing mechanisms similar to previous amcs aimed at promoting equitable access to pneumococcal and ebola vaccines [26] covax incentivized vaccine manufacturers to invest in production capacity by guaranteeing purchasing volumes before a vaccine is licensed the 92 amceligible countries  gross national income (gni) per capita under us$4000 and world bank international development association (ida) eligible  will be able to access the subsidized vaccine cost (up to us$160  us$2 per dose) while fully selffinancing countries can either participate in a committed purchase arrangement or optional purchase arrangement [24 27 28]committed purchase requires the country participants to pay us$160 per dose upfront or 15% of the price per dose and commit to pay the rest of the balance later the optional purchase country participants will have to provide higher upfront payment of us$350 per dose (us$310 per dose plus a risksharing guarantee of us$040 per dose) but have the ability to opt out without penalty [24] through covax no receiving country (the amceligible economies) will be able to secure vaccine doses for more than 20% of its population until all countries have received sufficient doses for at least 20% of their population [24 2729]currently covax has raised us$14 billion toward the efforts and is aiming to raise at least us$2 billion by the end of 2020 [24] as of november 24 2020 184 countries were participating in covax including 94 low and middleincome countries eligible to access the sarscov2 vaccines through gavis covax advance market commitment [30]the considerable public investments in research and development and the manufacturing of vaccines against sarscov2 have shifted much of the financial risk away from the pharmaceutical industry thus reducing the vaccines cost and accelerating production with such terms governments are left to ensure that their health systems have the adequate cold chain and infrastructure to store and deliver those vaccines countries with limited resources to adjust their cold chain will benefit from other vaccines currently nearing approval (as of december 14 2020) with less constricting requirements low and middleincome countries will benefit from gavi support through the advanced market commitment which implies a staged worldwide distribution of the new vaccines all countries will receive vaccines at the same rate with these mechanisms in place we hope that vaccines will be available to all everywhere and without any financial challenges
241	1	Over the summer the food and drug administration announced that in order for an experimental covid19 vaccine to get the green light it would need to be safe and prevent disease or decrease its severity in at least 50 percent of people who are vaccinatedin fact no vaccine is 100 percent effective but some work better than others one of the most successful is the measles vaccine  two doses are 97 percent effective in preventing the disease according to the centers for disease control and preventionfull coverage of the coronavirus outbreakstill 50 percent sounds like a far cry from 97 percenti know that 50 percent does sound low but that is still some protection and some protection is better than no protection said dr jeff kwong professor of public health and family medicine and interim director of the centre for vaccine preventable diseases at the university of torontopublic trust in a covid19 vaccineoct 26 20200131based on the effectiveness threshold the fda has set for a covid19 vaccine to be approved or granted emergency use authorization its possible a vaccine becomes available that helps only half of people receiving it while offering no benefit to the other half its also possible that a vaccine could have different effects in different people  helping to prevent disease in some people while reducing the severity of covid19 in othersbut even if a covid19 vaccine is only 50 percent effective it could make a difference experts say pointing out that the flu vaccine effectiveness can vary widely from year to year anywhere from 20 percent to 60 percent over the last decade and the shots still offer benefits when the flu vaccine matches up well with the influenza viruses that are circulating the shots can reduce illness hospitalizations and deaths the cdc saysand if enough people were immunized a covid19 vaccine wouldnt need to be nearperfect to have a substantial impact in the community said dr gregory poland director of the mayo clinics vaccine research group and editorinchief of the journal vaccineif you had a 60 or 70 percent effective vaccine and everybody took it you might actually be reaching toward herd immunity and potentially then dampen down this pandemic poland saidbut researchers wont know how effective the experimental vaccines are  if they are effective at all  until studies are completedget the morning rundownget a head start on the mornings top storiesenter your emailsign upthis site is protected by recaptcha privacy policy | terms of servicerelatednewsteens tweens volunteer for vaccine trials while opponents call the move absurd crazyright now we have no idea if any of these vaccines work said vaccine researcher dr peter hotez dean of the national school of tropical medicine at the baylor college of medicine in houstonmost clinical trials underway now primarily are assessing whether covid19 vaccines prevent disease poland explained study results also may include additional information such as whether vaccinated people who still contracted the virus became less sick than unvaccinated people who contracted itrecommendedthe data pointmap monkeypox confirmed in 16 countriesdata graphicsstates are rolling out vaccination plans track the number of inoculations across the countrydownload the nbc news app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakonce the studies are complete they also may reveal who benefited the most from vaccination data for instance may show how a vaccine affected men as against women various age groups or people with underlying health conditions future studies and longer followups may provide additional details about whether the vaccines ultimately reduce hospitalizations and deathsavailability of a vaccine likely wont mean an immediate end to the pandemic experts saybecause it would take time to immunize millions of people precautions such as masks social distancing and handwashing would remain important as long as the virus is circulating in the communityeven if the first generation of covid19 vaccines arent as effective as hoped hotez said hes not planning to pass up any of them there might be the possibility he could get a booster later or even receive a different more effective vaccine at some point he said for now though he would take what he can geti would feel much better knowing that i got vaccinated and have some levels of virusneutralizing antibody in my system he said even if its not the best vaccine it still could prevent me from going to the hospital or worse

participants became infected in between taking the first and second doses highlighting the need to get the second dose (efficacy after just the first dose was only 52%) if you take both doses its very likely youll be protected from covid19 at the very least in the short termbut still a lot find outoverall this trial provided confidence in the vaccines efficacy and robustly documented its safety however this doesnt mean the study shows what will happen in the real world we cannot presume that the experiences of 19000 vaccinated individuals will extrapolate to millions of peopleits impossible to detect less common sideeffects for example this is why very close monitoring of the vaccine now needs to happen as it rolls out and authorities will need to rapidly respond if people have unexpected reactions to it decisive action has already been seen in the uk in response to previously unseen sideeffects in people with a significant history of allergic reactionssimilarly its possible that the efficacy of the vaccine in the real world  what we call its effectiveness  may also decrease as it is used in more diverse populations and over longer time periodsand there are still key questions that need to be answered  particularly around the length of protection the vaccine will offer its almost certain that the immune response initially generated will wane over time we dont yet know the lowest amount of immunity that needs to be retained to protect against infection nor what type of immunity provides this protectionif vaccineinduced immune responses  such as antibodies or t cells  can wane to very low levels but still prevent infection then this vaccine will protect people for a long time but if immune responses must be constantly kept high for protection it wontat present we only have two methods to find out which is the case the first is to continue monitoring the effects of the vaccine in the clinical trial participants but to get a robust answer there will have to continue to be people in the unvaccinated placebo arm of the study which poses an ethical question how do you balance the need to retain a placebo cohort with the rights of all participants to be able to access a successful vaccine the trial protocol suggests that followup should last for 24 months after vaccinationthis balance might be achieved by initially prioritising vaccination for the most vulnerable placebo participants and aiming to persuade the less vulnerable participants to remain in the trial but if huge numbers of participants leave the trial then the robustness of the analysis will deteriorate we would then never know with good confidence how well this vaccine works over timethe second method would be to expose people to sarscov2 under controlled conditions and see what happens (these experiments are known as human infection studies such trials are being planned in the uk and should be very powerful tools for finding out the levels and types of immunity needed to protect against infection in the long term																
243	1	With the us food and drug administrations emergency use authorization of two covid19 vaccinesfirst pfizerbiontechs tozinameran vaccine on december 11 2020 followed by modernas mrna1273 vaccine on december 18 2021 health officials are edging ever closer to achieving herd immunity in the united states and hopefully towards an end to the global pandemic as we know it2these hopes are bolstered by the fact that these vaccines are each said to afford an efficacy of over 90% rendering what public health officials describe as effective or practical immunity effective immunity is the development of antibodies to prevent infection effective immunity can be achieved through either infection or vaccination and it is possible that asymptomatic infection may still occur3despite the positive findings the results did not assess whether or not these vaccines provide significant sterilizing immunity (if the immune response completely blocks infection including asymptomatic infection it can be referred to as sterilizing immunity) questions remain about how many people would need to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity in the united states and around the worldhow does modernas vaccine measure up to pfizersmasked woman getting covid19 vaccinehalfpoint images / getty imagestypes of immunityimmunity in its simplest terms is the bodys ability to resist infections this is mediated not only by white blood cells that are central to the innate immune responsethe bodys inborn defensebut also antibodies that make up the adaptive (aka acquired) immune response the innate and adaptive immune responses are each made up of complicated networks of cells that work with each other to provide immune defensesthe innate immune system recognizes many pathogens but does not learn to adapt to new ones over a lifetime on the other hand the adaptive immune system which is largely composed of bcells and certain types of tcells learns from and responds to new challenges and retains a memory of those challenges in later lifeadaptive immunity can develop in one of two wayswhen you are infected by an infectious agent like covid19 during which the immune system will respond in a way that is tailormade to that attacker and usually that attacker alone this can include antibodies (made by bcells) or by tcell mediated immune responseswhen you are vaccinated during which compounds are introduced into the body to stimulate a specific immune response to the disease specific to that vaccine that immune response can last for months years or a lifetime long depending on the vaccine type and a persons response to itantibodies from vaccines vs natural infectionwith vaccines the level of immune protection can vary as can the goals of vaccination some vaccines offer sterilizing immunity in which a diseasecausing pathogen is completely unable to replicate vaccines developed for the human papillomavirus (hpv) are one such example where viral replication is completely blocked in most vaccinated humansin other instances a vaccine can offer effective (or practical) immunity in which the vaccine can greatly reduce the risk of infection but may not prevent asymptomatic infection so while the risk of illness is greatly reduced a person can still be a carrier and able to spread the virusthe seasonal flu vaccine which is 40% to 50% effective in preventing infection is an example where people who get the vaccine get the flu less often get fewer symptoms and are less likely to transmit it to others4 the current covid19 vaccines may fall into the same category albeit at a far higher level of effectivenessas effective as the pfizerbiontech and moderna vaccines are in preventing illness we dont know yet if they will entirely erase the risk of infection or further transmission of the viruswhat can we expect from a covid19 vaccinehow effective immunity developseffective immunity to infections like covid19 requires the synthesis of specific antibodies that recognize and bind to a specific protein on the pathogen called an antigensome of these antibodies are neutralizing meaning that they bind to a pathogen in order to prevent it from attacking and killing a host cell without the means to infect and replicate a virus like covid19 will quickly dieother antibodies are nonneutralizing meaning that they are unable to prevent infection but rather tag the invader for neutralization by other defensive cellswhat does a positive covid antibody test meanbeyond antibodiesthere are also b cell lymphocytes (b cells) produced by the bone marrow that become activated in the presence of an antigen often with the help of t cells these are the cells that actually produce antibodiessome of the b cells are effector cells meaning that they are shortlived and designed to defend the body others are memory cells which are longliving and serve as sentinels should the pathogen returnif the invader does return memory b cells can start churning out new antibodies to prevent infection or reinfection this means that even if the neutralizing antibodies from the covid vaccines begin to wane the immune system would still have memory of the virus and may still be able to launch a rapid immune assaultcan you get reinfected with covid19concerns and challengesthe fact that the pfizerbiontech and moderna vaccines are less than 100% effective does not mean that they are less than able to bring the current pandemic under control they can but there are challengesasymptomatic infectionschief among the concerns is the aforementioned risk of asymptomatic infection currently without the vaccine 1 in 5 people are believed to experience covid19 with no evidence of illness5 with vaccination asymptomatic disease can still occur and with it the risk of silent transmission of the virus to others we still dont know how well the new vaccines will prevent this from happeningthere remains some debate on how infectious asymptomatic people truly are although the current body of evidence suggests that the risk is significantly reduced compared with symptomatic peopleaccording to december 2020 study from bond university which analyzed 13 studies from six countries people with asymptomatic infection are 42% less likely to transmit the virus than those with symptoms6as such even if an infection were to occur in a vaccinated individual it would likely be mild to asymptomatic and far less transmissable with the rapid and effective rollout of communitywide vaccinations the rate of infections should not only drop but also the overall virulence (severity) of covid19 infectionssymptoms of covid19 you may not knowvaccine durabilitythe one factor that scientists do not yet know is how durable the protection from the vaccines will be although the protection is believed to be longlasting in part because the virus mutates slowly it will be some time before realworld data can support thiswhile the evidence suggests that the antibody response from these rna vaccines is strong it will take time before scientists are able to determine how durable the response is and what quantity of memory b cells are generated after vaccination the latter remains a concern given that antibody levels will invariably wane over time after vaccination7until these questions are answered it is anyones guess if the protection from these firstgeneration vaccines will be as longlasting as many hope or require booster shots4 ways to ensure covid19 vaccine safetymoving aheadto better ensure herd immunity the uptake of vaccinations among americans not only needs to be high but fast a slow or delayed rollout might make it more likely that an odd genetic variant resistant to the vaccineinduced antibodies could escape and spread some of which may be more infectious or virulent than othersthere is concern that one such variant has already developed in great britain in which changes in the viruss genome (called an h69/v70 deletion) has suggested a potentialalbeit smallrisk for treatment resistance8 however this variant is not suspected to have developed because of vaccine immunity because the variant preceded the vaccineby vaccinating as many americans as quickly as possible community infectivity can be reduced as well as the risk of viral escape mutants the less a vaccine prevents asymptomatic infection and transmission the more important it is to ensure the rapid distribution and uptake of the vaccinethis could be a challenge given ongoing troublesome public doubts about the covid19 vaccines and vaccinations in general in september 2020 prior to the news about the pfizerbiontech breakthrough only 576% of responders to a university of massachusetts survey said that they were definitely getting the vaccine when available9 however it is encouraging that these numbers have improved since vaccine approval and rollouta december 2020 study in the journal vaccine suggested similar levels of public resistance but went on to report that only 19% had a great deal of confidence in the safety and effectiveness of any covid19 vaccine10although these figures are likely to improve as the vaccines gain acceptance ongoing engagement with the public is needed particularly with regards to dispelling misinformation and restoring trust in government agencies particularly in communities of color which have higher rates of covid19 infection and death and high rates of vaccine hesitancy11even as concerns about the virus hopefully start to wane as more and more people get vaccinated current public health measures including social distancing and face masks will likely need to be sustained

are working on various types of realworld assessments using different methods including the following as outlined by the cdccasecontrol studiesthese assessments will include cases (people who have the virus that causes covid19) and controls (people who do not have the virus that causes covid19) the people who agree to participate in a casecontrol assessment will provide information on whether they received a covid19 vaccine or notexperts will look to see if the cases were less likely to have received the vaccine than controls which would help show that the vaccine is workingtestnegative designthis is a special type of casecontrol study these assessments will enroll people who are seeking medical care for symptoms that could be due to covid19 experts will then compare the covid19 vaccination status of those who test positive (meaning they have covid19) to those who test negative (meaning they do not have covid19)cohort studiesthese assessments will follow people who have and havent had a covid19 vaccine for several months to see if getting vaccinated protects them from getting the disease this can be done in real time (prospectively) or by looking back in time (retrospectively) using data that were already collected such as information in participants electronic health records (medical records)screening methodthese assessments look at vaccination coverage among a group of cases (for example cases detected through ongoing covid19 surveillance) and compares it with vaccination coverage among the overall population where those cases come from (for example people from the same state) by comparing coverage among these two groups researchers can get an early estimate of whether a vaccine is working as expectedecologic analysesthese assessments look at groups of people  such as those in different geographic locations or at different times  and find out how many people were vaccinated and how many people were diagnosed with covid19 these analyses may be hard to interpret since the number of covid19 illnesses has changed rapidly over time and in different places the cdc noteducla doctor receives covid19 vaccine december 2020a university of

245	1	The success of a covid19 vaccine will depend on its efficacy and will also hinge on how fast and widely it can be delivered the severity of the pandemic and the publics willingness to be immunized according to a study by harvard medical school researchers based at massachusetts general hospitalthe study published in health affairs finds that far more investment is needed to ensure that approved covid19 vaccines can be produced and distributed efficiently and that more must be done to promote the publics trust in immunization and its willingness to continue practices that slow the spread of sarscov2 rochelle walensky an hms professor of medicine and chief of the division of infectious diseases at mass general is senior author on the studyget more hms news herebillions of dollars have been spent on developing covid19 vaccines and preliminary evidence suggests that several candidates appear to be extraordinarily effectivebut there are lots of ways to think about the effectiveness of a vaccine said walenskyshe teamed with a david paltiel professor of public health at the yale school of public health and several other colleagues to create a mathematical model that assessed how factors beyond efficacy might influence how well a covid19 vaccine will thwart the disease those factors includedhow fast and broadly can the vaccine be produced and administered some candidate vaccines pose logistical challenges such as needing to be stored in ultracold freezers or requiring two doses spaced weeks apartthe portion of the population is willing to be vaccinated national surveys suggest that as few as 50 percent of americans say they will receive a covid19 vaccinethe severity of the pandemic when a vaccine is rolled out the proportion of infections a vaccine is able to avert is directly related to the publics willingness to engage in mitigation behaviors such as wearing masks and social distancingthe mathematical model they employed considered how these factors would influence the impact of vaccines of varying levels of efficacywe found that infrastructure will contribute at least as much to the success of the vaccination program as will the vaccine itself said paltiel the population benefits of vaccination will decline rapidly in the face of manufacturing or deployment delays significant vaccine hesitancy or greater epidemic severity he addedto help ensure a vaccination programs success walensky said that a significantly greater investment in infrastructure to deliver covid19 vaccines is neededmoreover powerful public messages and ontheground implementation strategies at the local level are also necessary to help overcome skepticism about vaccines especially in underserved populationsthe health affairs study showed that even a highly effective vaccine will struggle to control covid19 if infection rates continue to riseif i have a cup of water i can put out a stove fire but i cant put out a forest fire even if that water is 100 percent potent said walensky emphasizing the publics role in keeping the infection rate low by wearing masks and practicing social distancing

series and booster vaccination for booster vaccines see the separate section belowfor most groups who are offered the coronavirus vaccine the primary vaccination series comprises of two doses the second dose should be given after 312 weeks it is important that you try to take the second dose at the scheduled time the interval between doses can be important both for the degree of protection and for the validity of the covid19 certificaterecommended minimum interval between dose 1 and 2 for vaccines offered in the coronavirus immunisation programmevaccinenumber of doses to complete primary

immunisation programme two doses are required for the primary vaccination series if it is difficult to give two doses with the same vaccine or is requested for other reasons the norwegian institute of public health recommends combining the vaccines when combining two different coronavirus vaccines in the primary vaccination series (doses 1 and 2) a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses is recommended no upper limit has yet been established for the interval between coronavirus vaccinesnot everyone is given primary vaccination with two doses* people who have had covid19 only need one vaccine dose to complete their primary vaccination seriespeople with severely weakened immune systems (immunosuppressed) often have a poorer effect of vaccines than others this means that many of these do not get a good enough effect from the first two doses this group is therefore offered dose 3 in order to complete primary vaccination for these an interval between the 2nd and 3rd dose is recommended to be a minimum of 4 weeks more information about this group can be found hereeasier access to third dose for people with suppressed immune systemsbooster dosesprotection after primary vaccination with a coronavirus vaccine may diminish over time a booster dose gives longerterm protection as well as a broader protection that can make us better prepared against new virus variantsrecommendation and offer of a booster dose for people aged 18 and overthe advice about booster doses applies regardless of whether you have been vaccinated with (a) two vaccine doses or b) had covid19 and one vaccine dose in norway we consider both covid19 disease and vaccination to be equivalent immunological events as long as at least 3 weeks have passed between each of them this means that an infection is equivalent to one vaccine dose the interval between dose 2 (or having covid19) and the booster dose must be at least 20 weekseveryone in the age group 45 years and older and nursing home residents is recommended to have one booster dosepeople 18 years and older who belong to the risk groups are recommended to have one booster doseall employees in the health and care service are recommended to have one booster doseotherwise healthy people aged 1844 can have one booster dosethe municipalities shall first prioritise booster doses to those who are 65 years or older and nursing home residents then the municipalities will set up the order so that those who have waited the longest are given priority first this will also ensure that the elderly and risk groups are given priority as soon as possiblethe norwegian institute of public health considers that confirmed covid19 disease among people who have had their primary vaccination series (under 65 years) more than 3 weeks after dose 2 can replace the medical need for a booster dose however people who want a booster dose despite having had covid19 after dose 2 can take it this may be due to entry requirements to some countries or for other reasons for the age group 65 years and older a booster dose is recommended if covid19 is detected before 3 months have passed since the dosepeople with severely impaired immune systems (immunosuppressed) follow a separate vaccination courseread moresay yes when you are offered a booster dosemore people will be offered a booster doseoffer of 2nd booster dose for people 80 years and olderthe norwegian institute of public health considers that based on current knowledge and the situation in norway there is no basis to give a general recommendation for a second booster dose (dose 4) to all the elderly the norwegian institute of public health has nevertheless opened up for people aged 80 and older who have received 3 doses and have not had covid19 since then to receive a new booster dose (dose 4) if they so wish the dose can be given no earlier than 4 months after the last booster dose (dose 3) a new dose now will not necessarily rule out the need for an additional booster dose in the autumn when transmission is expected to increasebooster doses for people with severe immune deficiencypeople with severely weakened immune systems are recommended 3 doses in the primary vaccination series plus one booster dose 3 months after dose 3for this patient group there are still many who have not taken the recommended booster dose (dose 4) it is therefore important that more people do it to reduce the risk of severe covid19 diseasein addition some people with severely weakened immune systems after assessment by their doctor may be offered an additional booster dose if it is relevant to vaccinate people with severely weakened immune systems beyond the 4 doses already recommended the doctor can assess which vaccine and which dose interval is most appropriate to achieve the benefit from a booster dose an interval of minimum 3 months is recommended from the previous dosehow do mrna vaccines worktwo of the three approved coronavirus vaccines used in the coronavirus immunisation programme are mrna vaccines comirnaty (from biontech/pfizer) and spikevax (from moderna)the vaccines contains the recipe (messenger rna or mrna) for the characteristic spikes on the coronavirus encased in small fat bubbles the body uses this recipe to make harmless copies of these spikes for the immune system to practise on in this way the immune system learns to recognise the coronavirus spikes and can defend the body if it becomes infected with the virusthe messenger rna is rapidly broken down by the body and has no effect on the bodys genetic materialin addition the vaccines contain substances to keep them stable during production storage and transport as well as to provide the right ph which is important for reducing pain during injection these substances are water salts and sugarthe vaccines do not contain live virus and do not cause covid19 diseaseantibiotics are not used in the production process so the vaccines do not contain antibiotics or antibiotic residuesthe vaccines do not contain adjuvants which are substances that are added to some vaccines to increase the immune systems response the vaccines do not contain products derived from pigs the vaccines do not contain mercurythe coronavirus vaccines act to prevent disease they cannot cure an ongoing illnessmore information about mrna vaccinesvaccine against coronavirus  comirnaty (biontech and pfizer)vaccine against coronavirus  spikevax (previously covid19 vaccine modernahow does nuvaxovid (novavax) workthe coronavirus vaccine nuvaxovid (from novavax) is a proteinbased vaccine based on a traditional vaccine technology similar technology is used in vaccine against hepatitis b and whooping cough it contains a variant of the characteristic spikes (spike protein) on the coronavirus that the immune system can practise on this is how the body learns to recognise and defend itself against real coronavirus if you later become infectedthe vaccine also contains a new ingredient (adjuvant) containing saponins from soap bark and fats (cholesterol and phospholipids) this helps to enhance the bodys own immune response to get the best possible effect from the vaccine nuvaxovid also contains an emulsifier (polysorbate 80) which ensures that fats and water in the adjuvant remain evenly mixedin addition the vaccine contains water various salts and sugar compounds that will keep it stable during production storage and transport as well as provide the right ph that is important for reducing pain during injectionthe vaccine does not contain live viruses and does not cause coronavirus diseaseantibiotics are not used in the production process so the vaccines do not contain antibiotics or antibiotic

vaccine against coronavirus  nuvaxovid (novavax) coronavirus vaccine from novavax will be available in week 10 (news niph)vaccination with different coronavirus vaccinesthe coronavirus immunisation programme in norway uses the two mrna vaccines from biontech / pfizer and moderna (see above) and the proteinbased vaccine nuvaxovid from novavax for most people two doses are needed to complete the primary vaccination series and several groups are also recommended to have a booster dose to get the best possible protection some will be offered or request a different coronavirus vaccine as dose 2 or as a booster vaccine than the one they began with in principle you are recommended to accept the vaccine you are offered but it is also possible to choose which type of vaccine you want to takevaccines from biontech / pfizer and moderna can be combinedside effects and symptoms after vaccinationthe coronavirus vaccines can cause side effects in many of those vaccinated but they are mostly mild / moderate and pass after a few days for some the symptoms may be more severe the mrna vaccines appear to cause more of the common side effects than other vaccines nuvaxovid generally has slightly milder side effects with a shorter duration than the mrna vaccinesthe side effects after all three coronavirus vaccines usually occur during the first 12 days after vaccination common side effects are pain and swelling at the injection site fatigue headache muscle aches chills joint pain and fever allergic reactions occur in some people there is good knowledge about common side effects after vaccination but rare side effects cannot be ruled outamong the rarer side effects reported from mrna vaccines are inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) and inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis) the condition most often occurs among adolescents and young adults it also seems to occur more often with the use of spikevax (moderna) than with comirnaty (biontech/pfizer) when offering mrna vaccines to people under 30 years the niph recommends the use of comirnaty for both men and womenamong those who experience these rare symptoms they usually appear within a week after the second dose and are temporary so that most people recover within one month the condition causes chest pain wheezing palpitations and fever in case of such symptoms consult a doctor for a medical examination norwegian cardiologists consider that covid19 disease can cause more serious heart effects in some people than after the vaccine and that this rare side effect should not prevent adolescents from being offered the vaccinecases of menstrual disorders have been reported as a possible side effect in young women following coronavirus vaccination this is being closely monitoredsymptoms that occur in the period after vaccination are not always due to the vaccine vaccine side effects can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from symptoms of infections or other diseases if you experience unexpected severe or prolonged symptoms after vaccination you should contact your doctor or other healthcare professional for assessment and advice healthcare professionals have a duty to report serious or unknown reactions that they suspect are due to a vaccine you can also send a message via the form via helsenorgenofollowup of side effectswhen vaccines are developed the goal is always for vaccines to give the best possible effect with the fewest possible side effects even if the new vaccines are tested thoroughly rare side effects cannot be ruled out some side effects are only discovered when vaccines are in wider use and have been given to many more people and to more varied groups than in the studiesafter the vaccines are in use the norwegian medicines agency together with the norwegian institute of public health will monitor closely whether any unexpected side effects arise there is also extensive international collaboration with the other countries that use the same vaccines in addition the vaccine manufacturers are required to conduct new systematic safety studieswhat happens to the notifications about side effectsthe norwegian institute of public health (niph) collaborates with the regional medicine information and pharmacovigilance centres (relis) to process reports of suspected side effects from healthcare personnel the notifications are entered in the adr registry at the norwegian medicines agencythe norwegian medicines agency publishes regular reports with an overview of reports of suspected adverse reactions after vaccination in norwayread more about reported suspected adverse reaction from coronavirus vaccines at the norwegian medicines agencynotifications from healthcare professionals are thoroughly assessed to find out if the incident may be due to the vaccine or if it happened at the same time as vaccination it is important to be aware that events that coincide in time are not necessarily due to vaccination therefore a medical examination is recommended to check for other explanations for the events in some cases it can be difficult to conclude whether an event is due to a vaccine or coincidence based on one or a few single eventsshow moreprotection and immunity after vaccinationall three vaccines used in the coronavirus immunisation programme protect against covid19 diseasethe vaccines have a very good effect against a covid19 disease course that is so serious that hospital treatment is needed this means that in those cases where people have covid19 despite vaccination the vaccine can contribute to a milder disease course this also seems to apply to the omicron variant however vaccination does not provide as good protection against infection with the omicron variant the protection is poorer and shorter in duration than against the delta variantwe are closely monitoring the duration of protection in different groups adults over 45 years and those with underlying conditions are recommended to have a booster dose because protection diminishes over time see abovealthough vaccinated people have a much lower risk than unvaccinated people of getting covid19 vaccinated people could also be infected and transmit infection further therefore it is important that vaccinated people follow the current infection control advicevirus variantsuntil now the vaccines have had a good effect against the various mutated virus variants it is currently uncertain how good the protection will be against the omicron variantalthough recent data suggest a lower vaccine effect against mild disease for some of the virus variants vaccination may still give good protection against a severe disease courseif we get virus variants where the vaccines do not work then the vaccines can be adapted to improve the degree of protectionshow morevaccination of pregnant and breastfeeding womenadvice to pregnant and breastfeeding women about coronavirus vaccinationvaccination

(film)questions and answers about vaccination of 515yearoldswhy are children aged 515 offered a coronavirus vaccinethe niph does not have a general recommendation for the coronavirus vaccine for children aged 515 years but it is available those who want to take the vaccine can choose whether they want 1 or 2 doses the niph considers that when children have covid19 it provides at least as good protection as vaccination children who have had an infection therefore do not need a vaccine to protect themselves against a new infectionthe niphs assessments for children aged 515 where they and their parents want a vaccine but the child has had covid19those who have had covid19 and would otherwise choose 1 vaccine dose do not need more because 1 dose of vaccine corresponds to the protection from having had covid19those who have had covid19 and would otherwise choose 2 vaccine doses only need 1 vaccine dose since having had covid19 corresponds to 1 vaccine dose (as long as at least 3 weeks have passed between the positive test and the vaccine)other countries may have stricter requirements in connection with entry restrictions if you need a valid covid19 certificate for travel you must check which requirements apply for children at your destinationcan vaccination of children against coronavirus reduce transmission in societythe norwegian institute of public health considers that the societal benefit of vaccinating children should not be given as much weight as the individual benefit vaccination of children 511 years and a second dose to 1215yearolds may have some effect on transmission however the vaccines effect against transmission of the omicron variant appears to be lower and has a shorter duration than against previous virus variants therefore the effect on transmission by vaccinating the entire child population will be limited when the infection will transmit regardless among the vaccinatedhow ill can 515 year olds become from coronavirusthe risk of a severe covid19 disease course among healthy children is very low there is no evidence that the omicron variant causes more severe disease among children than previous variants the immune systems of children in this age group work faster and more effectively than in adults they therefore become less ill and recover faster than adultssevere covid19 disease in children is particularly associated with a rare inflammatory condition called misc it is estimated that the condition occurs in about 1 in 3000 infected children and is more common in children of primary school age than in adolescents the hallmarks of misc are persistent high fever and inflammatory reaction in several organs that occur 26 weeks after infection and the children need hospital treatment there is effective treatment for the condition but the most serious cases still need intensive care hospital stays for these children last 5 days (median) in norway followup 49 months after misc internationally indicates a good prognosis and this is also the experience in norwaypeople who have had covid19 disease may in some cases have persistent symptoms for a long time afterwards in adults a clear correlation has been seen between the severity of acute covid19 disease and the severity of long term problems it may seem that such late effects are less common in children than in adults but knowledge about this is limited the most commonly reported symptoms are fatigue tiredness difficulty concentrating stuffy nose sleep problems and pain the number of reported symptoms appears to decrease over timedo children get better protection from covid19 disease than from the vaccineimmunity following infection with or without a dose of vaccine can provide broad and lasting protection in children and adolescents it may be an advantage for protection against new virus variants in the future as the risk of a severe disease course in this age group is lowwhich vaccine is offered to the 515 year age groupin norway children and adolescents are only offered the comirnaty vaccine from biontech and pfizer even though spikevax from moderna has been approved from the age of 12 and up this is to minimize the risk of rare side effects in the form of heart inflammation it is also one of the most widely used coronavirus vaccines in children comirnaty is approved from 5 years and upwards and the age group 511 years will receive an adapted child dosagehow good protection do 515yearolds get from coronavirus vaccinechildren receive very good protection from the coronavirus vaccine the protection against a severe disease course is good already three weeks after vaccination with one dose this age group generally has a very good effect of vaccines and it will probably be better than for older age groups this also applies to the omicron variant the vaccines protection against becoming infected and against mild illness is lower than against serious illnesswhat side effects can 515 year olds get from covid19 diseasethe vast majority of side effects occur 12 days after vaccination are mild / moderate and disappear after a few days for some the symptoms may be more severe the coronavirus vaccines cause more of the common side effects than other vaccines younger people often have slightly more severe side effects than older peoplecommon side effects are injection and swelling at the injection site fatigue headache muscle aches chills joint pain and fever children aged 511 years more often experience pain at the injection site but slightly less common side effects such as fatigue headache muscle aches and fever compared to adolescents and young adults allergic reactions occur in some people including children and adolescentsamong the rarer side effects reported are inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) and inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis) the condition most often occurs in adolescents and young adults but is also described in children aged 511 years the condition occurs primarily after the second vaccine dose and is more common in men than in women the symptoms are chest pain wheezing palpitations and fever it usually occurs within a week after vaccination most of those who get this condition are admitted to hospital for a few days the prognosis is good and most people recover within one month in case of symptoms that may be compatible with inflammation of the heart muscle or pericardium you must consult a doctor to be examined norwegian cardiologists have assessed that covid19 disease may cause more severe cardiac effects in some people than the vaccine and that this rare side effect should not prevent children from being offered the vaccinecases of menstrual disturbances have been reported as a possible side effect after coronavirus vaccine preliminary results from a population study in norway show that there may be an increased incidence of menstrual disorders in young women aged 1830 years after coronavirus vaccination after the first dose most menstrual disorders were transient for the second dose the followup in the study is still ongoing knowledge of the corresponding incidence under the age of 18 is limited and the interpretation of the data is particularly demanding in the youngest age group because it is normal to have an irregular cycle in the time after the first menstruation there is no suspicion that the vaccines affect womens fertilitythere is less experience with coronavirus vaccination of children 5 11 years than there is for the other age groups we cannot rule out hitherto unknown side effects for this age group rare side effects or side effects that arise long after vaccinationcan children who have had covid19 disease be vaccinatedimmunity following infection with or without a dose of vaccine can provide broad and lasting protection in children and adolescents in norway we consider both covid19 disease and vaccination to be equivalent to immunological events as long as at least 3 weeks have passed between each of them this means that the infection is equivalent to one dose of vaccine having had covid19 plus one vaccine dose is equivalent to two vaccine dosesit is possible for those who want two vaccine doses to have them despite having had covid19 this may be due to entry requirements to some countries or other nonmedical reasonshow do i get vaccinatedthe organisation will vary between the municipalities see your municipalitys website for information about the local offerhow do i get an overview of vaccination status in children and adolescentsfor children under the age of 16 the parents can see the vaccines the child has received by logging in to the vaccine service on helsenorgeno and choosing the child in questionthose who have reached the age of 16 are of legal age and can consent to vaccination themselves for younger children (including those born in 2005 but not yet 16 years of age) parental consent must be obtained in the case of joint parental responsibility there must be consent from both parentssince the legal age of majority in norway is 16 years parents do not have access to their childs immunisation status after their 16th birthday buypass id is available from the age of 13 years adolescents with this id can check their vaccines themselves by logging in to the vaccine service at helsenorgenoadolescents between the ages of 16 and 18 years who

immunity from having had covid19 lastspeople who have had covid19 before their first dose of vaccine are considered to have completed the primary vaccination series after one vaccine dose if the interval between the positive test and vaccination is 3 weeks or more if the interval is shorter than 3 weeks the vaccine dose will still count the person will then be considered to have completed primary vaccination after their second dose provided that the interval between vaccine doses is in accordance with the absolute minimum intervalthe advice about booster doses applies regardless of whether the primary vaccination series is completed with either two vaccine doses or having had covid19 plus one vaccine dose (see the section about booster doses)note that followup studies show that the protection after having had infection is good for the first 6 months and that the protective effect is better after longer intervals between the immune systems exposure to viruses and / or vaccines although the second vaccine dose will count as long as the absolute minimum interval is met the norwegian institute of public health recommends that the second vaccine dose is delayed until at least 3 months after recovery you can also choose to wait up to 6 months before the vaccine is given vaccine can be given at any time after this and will provide protection in the same way as a second vaccine doseadolescents aged 1215 years who have had covid19 disease are not currently recommended to be vaccinated read more about recommendations for adolescents aged 1215vaccination of children and adolescentspeople without valid documentation of having covid19 from norwayif you had covid19 while you were abroad or suspect that you have had it either in norway or abroad you can take an antibody serology test performed at a microbiological laboratory (ie not a rapid antigen test) in norway this will then be registered in the msis laboratory database and therefore shown on helsenorge the antibody test must be taken at the latest on the same day as the first dose is given to give a valid covid19 certificate based on the combination of infection and one dose of vaccine this applies regardless of how long it has been since the suspected infection as long as at least 3 weeks have passed together with documentation of having received one vaccine dose this is sufficient for you to be considered to have completed primary vaccinationas there is no requirement for a maximum interval between the disease and the vaccine (for one vaccine dose to be sufficient to complete primary vaccination) a pcr / equivalent test or rapid antigen test is not required (these differ from the antibody tests in that they document the timepoint of disease  by detecting antigens they document the presence of viral material at the time of testing) for the covid19 certificate data on antibody tests will be obtained from msis and linked to sysvakthis is reflected in the vaccination guidelines about vaccination after undergoing covid19 the norwegian institute of public health therefore considers that one vaccine dose is enough for those who have previously undergone covid19 (approved pcr test / other nat antigen test or antibody test *) this applies regardless of how long ago they had covid19 the norwegian institute of public health recommends that this dose is given 3 months after recovery as this provides the best protectionhowever antibody test results will not give a valid covid19 certificate based on having the disease alone because there is a requirement that the disease must be a maximum of 6 months back in time since pcr or antigen rapid tests are the only tests that can document disease at a specific time only these tests are approved for a certificate

women regardless of trimestershow morewhy do we vaccinatehaving undergone an infectious disease will often provide some protection (immunity) against reinfection but some diseases can cause such a strong inflammatory reaction in the body that for some people it can become dangerous some people become severely ill and may die or have serious medical complicationsa vaccine gives the body something to practise on that resembles the disease virus but that cannot cause the disease the immune system is stimulated so the body can recognise and fight the virus the vaccine quickly disappears from the body but has taught the body to defend itself if it is later exposed to infection we can easily and effectively protect ourselves against some of the dangerous infectious diseases without having to be exposed to the risk of having the diseasein addition vaccination can help to limit transmission in societywhat is meant by primary vaccination booster vaccination and partial

currently being tested in latestage trials across the globesome are considered old school  they use a traditional approach which uses real weakened or killed virus to spark this immune reactionothers use little pieces of the virus surface rather than a whole dead virus still other vaccines use a different inactive virus as a trojan horse to deliver genetic material from the covid19 virusand theres even newer technology that uses raw genetic material such as rna to achieve the same goal by instructing cells to start making proteins normally found on the outside of the virusmost covid19 vaccines

258	1	An interim analysis of clinical trials showed the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine had an average efficacy of 70% in protecting against the virus. Both pfizer-biontech and moderna reported preliminary results showing that their respective covid vaccines were around 95% effective. Astrazenecas vaccine appears to have an advantage when it comes to storage, affordability and distribution, jefferies analysts said. Watch nowvideo04:39astrazeneca executive explains positive covid vaccine resultslondon  the coronavirus vaccine being developed by astrazeneca and the university of oxford was found to be highly protective, potentially paving the way for a vaccine that is more affordable and easier to distribute than some of its peers. An interim analysis of clinical trials showed the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine had an average efficacy of 70% in protecting against the virus. Researchers said this figure could be as high as 90% by tweaking the dose, but the overall results show the vaccines efficacy is slightly lower than other leading candidates. Both pfizer-biontech and moderna reported preliminary results last week showing that their respective covid vaccines were around 95% effective. However, white house coronavirus advisor dr. Anthony fauci has previously said a vaccine that is 50% or 60% effective against the virus would be acceptable. It is hoped a covid vaccine could help to bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed more than 1.3 million lives worldwide. Huge challenges remain before a vaccine can be rolled out. The global battle to secure prospective supplies has raised concerns about equitable access, while questions remain over the logistics of mass production, distribution, and cost. Logisticsequity analysts at jefferies said it was challenging to compare the efficacy of astrazenecas vaccine with those of pfizer-biontech and moderna, citing key differences in how the trials have been conducted. The analysts highlighted weekly swabbing to detect covid-19 among participants involved in astrazenecas trials  not just confirmation of suspected cases by symptoms as in u. S. Trials. They also stressed that a meningococcal vaccine was used for comparison, not placebo. The oxford-astrazeneca vaccine was assessed over two dosing regimens. One showed an effectiveness of 90% when trial participants received a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month later. The other showed 62% efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. No hospitalizations or severe cases of the disease were reported in participants receiving the vaccine.

A motorcyclist wears a protective mask while sitting at the side of the road at the sabarmati riverfront in ahmedabad, india, on thursday, oct. 22, 2020. Sumit dayal | bloomberg | getty imagesthe jefferies analysts said that when it comes to storage, affordability and distribution, astrazenecas vaccine appears to have an advantage. The british pharmaceutical giant has said its vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (36-46 degrees fahrenheit) for at least six months and administered within existing health-care settings. It has also pledged to distribute the vaccine at no profit for the duration of the pandemic. The financial times has previously reported the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine, which requires two doses, is priced at approximately $3 to $4  significantly lower than the prices reported for pfizer-biontech and moderna. In comparison, moderna has said its vaccine candidate remains stable at the temperature of a standard home refrigerator for up to 30 days. It can also be stored for up to six months at minus 4 degrees fahrenheit. In august, the u. S. Biotechnology firm said it was charging $32 to $37 per dose for its vaccine for some customers. The pfizer-biontech vaccine requires a storage temperature of minus 94 degrees fahrenheit and requires special storage equipment and transportation. This could make it difficult for some countries to distribute. Pfizer is reportedly charging $20 per dose for its vaccine. Big beneficiariesstrategists at deutsche bank described the news from astrazeneca on monday as a big deal, saying a string of encouraging vaccine developments in recent weeks constituted an unprecedented victory for science. They suggested that emerging markets, most notably brazil, mexico, india and indonesia, were likely to be the big beneficiaries of the astazeneca vaccine. Thats because the cheaper cost of production and distribution of astrazeneca is especially relevant for lower and middle-income countries, they said. Astrazeneca has said it is making rapid progress in terms of manufacturing, with a capacity to produce up to 3 billion doses of the vaccine next year. The u. S. And india have agreed to procure 500 million doses of the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine, according to data compiled by researchers at duke universitys global health innovation centre. The eu has reached a deal to buy 400 million, and the covax facility, a global initiative aimed at ensuring equitable access to covid-19 treatments and vaccines, has ordered 300 million. The u. K. , japan, indonesia, brazil, and latin america excluding brazil have each confirmed orders of at least 100 million doses.																
259	1	Most human medicines, including vaccines, are small molecules or proteins. A decade ago, a company called moderna started on the premise of messenger rna (mrna) as a therapy. Only two rna-based therapies have been approved, neither being messenger rna. While its not the only company focused on mrna, its the front runner by far. Within eight years, it became the most valued biotechnology company before breaking a public offering record. Their stock has tripled to over $60 a share as the pandemic swept across the world. A quick look at their drugs in development reveals a laundry list of therapies for rare metabolic disorders, cancers, heart failure and a host of pathogens like zika virus, epstein-barr virus and the novel coronavirus, sars-cov-2. It is the mrna technology itself enabling them to tackle such diverse diseases with a single platform. The premise of any vaccine is to induce a long-lived immune memory in the form of b and t cells. Upon any encounter with a pathogen (which can be bacteria or viruses), these cells will recognise the danger and fight it off by destroying the pathogen and pathogen-infected cells. The danger signal takes the form of an antigen, a molecule that notifies the immune system of a pathogen. For sars-cov-2, the antigen targeted by b and t cells is usually a protruding spike protein on the surface of the virus. The challenge in vaccination is inducing this response, which requires a handshake between an antigen-presenting cell and a specific type of t cell, without getting people sick. Its the antigen peptide (smaller sections of antigen molecule) presented in this interaction that determines the target of the immune response. Common vaccines are weakened or inactivated versions of the virus, like the yearly flu or the polio vaccine children receive 2 months after birth. A huge variety of antigens, some useful and some not, can be presented since cells are receiving the entirety of the virus. Newer vaccines utilise other engineered, well-studied doses containing specific regions of the target pathogen to create specific immune reactions. Modernas challenger in the race for a covid-19 vaccine is based on this concept. Astra zenecas vaccine candidate is a non-replicating, weakened version of the common cold virus that contains the sars-cov-2 spike protein. This approach has been successful before as the first ebola vaccine. Other approaches simply inject the proteins researchers want the body to recognise as a danger, along with other molecules to raise the alarm initially for the vaccine response. For sars-cov-2, the surface spike protein is the most common target to be tested for vaccines. A diagram of an mrna vaccine in action. It shows a synthetic mrna being translated by a ribosome into individual proteins from sars-cov-2, which induce an immune response. Image: the conversation, cc by-sathe mrna vaccine belongs in the last potential category for a vaccine to prevent covid-19. Modernas vaccine candidate inserts mrna into cells, which is translated into the exact protein antigens researchers design for the immune response. Instead of manufacturing inactivated virus, viral carriers, or proteins, moderna manufactures these rna sequences. After delivery, a persons cells act as the factory, no virus necessary. By enabling the cells to generate the antigens, it avoids the costly, difficult purification of proteins and equips the proteins with typical features viral proteins have, like surface sugars and the correct 3d shape. The flexibility of this platform stems from the ease of working with genomic sequences. Inject the diligently-defined sequence of as, ts, cs, and gs and voila, the cells do the rest. They are easy to design, produce, and test once the sequence of the pathogen is known. Others cite safety and efficacy benefits, which may be theoretically true, but as with every medicine, will need to be fully tested. Many of these benefits are similarly shared with dna vaccines, which are slightly different in their design and delivery and are used in veterinary medicine. Do mrna vaccines have advantages over traditional protein vaccines? Scientifically, its still unclear. Early studies showed underwhelming results, but the molecular design and delivery of these vaccines has quickly progressed. Beyond manufacturing benefits, some have suggested that, in theory, they may require less adjuvant (a bolstering second molecule that signals danger! To our immune system) because the mrna itself is inherently stimulating to our immune systems. Considering the novelty of mrna vaccines clinically, there isnt great data regarding protein v. Mrna vaccines directly. While there may be theoretical benefits to this type of vaccine, it comes down to the tested efficacy and safety of a candidate and, perhaps more importantly in any therapeutic race, who is willing to invest the eight to nine figures required to see any return on their research. Covid-19 was identified on december 31, 2019. Five days later, the full sequence of the viral genome was obtained. Eight days after that, the frontrunner vaccine candidate for covid-19 was finalised at moderna: mrna-1273. Within 63 days, moderna administered their first dose in a nih-led phase 1 study. Considering the average timeline to develop a vaccine is 10-15 years, this is lightspeed acceleration through the scientific and regulatory gauntlet. Moderna doesnt have a single fda-approved medicine, making their covid-19 vaccine candidate extremely high stakes for their platform  not to mention the stakes for all the lives continually at risk for the virus and its socioeconomic upheaval. With a phase 3 protocol finalised, so far, so good for mrna-1273. Initial data from the phase 1 study highlighted safe and well tolerated responses across the dosages, although some worrisome reactions were noted. Moderna also mentioned neutralising antibody titre level ... Reaching or exceeding neutralising antibody titres generally seen in convalescent sera, meaning some volunteer study participants had antibodies that could inactivate the virus at levels higher than patients with covid-19. Although scientists are eagerly awaiting the final, complete phase 1 data, this short statement is exciting. In a study released to the preprint server biorxiv, kizzmekia corbett, darin edwards, and sarah leist lead a team centred at the nihs vaccine research centre profiling mrna-1273 in mice. The results continue the promising trend, showing mice vaccinated with mrna-1273 are protected from the virus, have neutralising antibody responses, and harbour fewer virions in the airways of the mice. This is exactly the type of immune response vaccines need to elicit. Phase 2, now underway, includes 600 patients receiving two doses. The preliminary nature of these data cant be overemphasised, but we can be hopeful. Questions remain as to the scale and cost of vaccinating the global population, but moderna highlights their partnership with lonza, a biotechnology manufacturing company, to supply 500 million to 1 billion doses annually. The messenger rna platform more than a decade in the works by moderna has been subbed in in the 9th inning with bases loaded. While it will take many more months to gather all the safety and efficacy data to properly assess this vaccine (and others), the progress thus far has been record-breaking in every measure.\																
260	1	Experts say the covid-19 vaccine is safe for most people. There are no known safety issues for pregnant people, those who are breastfeeding, or people whove tested positive for covid-19 in the past, according to experts. They note that people whove had severe allergic reactions to any ingredients in the vaccine should not get it. People who have autoimmune or other conditions should check with their doctor before getting the vaccine, experts say. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the covid-19 pandemic. The initial wave of covid-19 vaccine doses are being administered across the united states. The food and drug administration (fda) issued an emergency use authorizationtrusted source for the pfizer-biontech and moderna covid-19 vaccines. Both vaccines are made up of 2 doses given intramuscularly. The pfizer vaccine is given 21 days apart, while the moderna vaccine is administered 28 days apart. Heres what you need to know about whos getting vaccinated first and who can safely get the covid-19 inoculation. Is the vaccine safe? Dr. William schaffner, an infectious disease expert at vanderbilt university in tennessee, said both the moderna and pfizer vaccines are safe. Scientifically, these vaccines have been rigorously examined by now two external, tough committees, people not associated with the companies or the government, schaffner told healthline. And they have passed both committees with flying colors. Dr. Anne liu, an infectious disease physician at stanford health care in california, said theres no reason to worry about any potential long-term side effects from the vaccination. People who are worried about long-term side effects may somewhat misunderstand how vaccines work. This is not something that stays in your body very long, and the immune response that is generated is fairly quick and should settle down fairly quickly over several weeks, liu told healthline. Its not like medications that can accumulate in your body. Its not something that changes anything about your makeup so you can have effects from it later on, she said. Experts said theres no real difference in terms of safety or efficacy between the moderna and pfizer vaccines. To my assessment, they look very similar both in terms of safety and in terms of effectiveness, so im not recommending any preference for one over another, dr. Dean blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the university of california davis, told healthline. For the large majority of people, the covid-19 vaccine is safe. But there are some groups who may need to take into account additional considerations when deciding whether to get the covid-19 vaccine. These include: people with allergiespeople who are pregnant or breastfeedingpeople whove tested positive for covid-19people with underlying medical conditionschildren and adolescentspeople with allergiesthe centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has received early reportstrusted source that some people have experienced severe allergic reactions after getting the covid-19 vaccine. There have been a few patients who have had allergic reactions and [... ] that is always very concerning. It doesnt appear to be very common but, of course, anaphylaxis is very scary and it is life threatening, so it is a concern, blumberg told healthline. The cdc advises that people whove had a severe allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in the covid-19 vaccine to not get inoculated. People whove had a severe allergic reaction to other types of vaccines or injectable therapies should talk with their doctor about what would be best. Those with a history of severe allergic reactions that arent related to vaccinations (food, venom, pets, latex) can still get vaccinated. If a person has a severe allergic reaction to the first shot of the covid-19 vaccine, the cdc advises them not to get the second shot. Those without a history of severe allergic reactions will be observed for 15 minutes following vaccination. The cdc advises those with a history of severe allergic reactions to be observed for double that amount of time. If you do have a history of noteworthy allergic reactions in the past, were going to watch you for a half hour after you receive the vaccine, so i think things are in hand, schaffner said.																
261	1	In approximately four weeks, as i write this, i will have the option to receive a vaccine for covid-19. The vaccine is being offered to me because i work in a high-risk position as a first responder. It is optional for me to take the vaccine, so i need to ask myself: what are the pros and cons of getting it? My reason for taking the vaccine would be to reduce the risk of severe complications related to contracting covid-19. I observed a family member contract covid-19 and end up in the hospital. Fortunately, remdesivir, the first drug authorized by the food and drug administration (fda) to treat covid-19, was available to my family member, along with a plasma treatment. Their lung function was affected, and it has taken time for them to build back up their physical stamina and lung function following hospitalization. Read more: expert breaks down misconceptions about covid-19 vaccineprior to getting the vaccine, one of the first things i will do is talk to a couple of my health care providers regarding their thoughts on the vaccines. I want to know if, in their opinion, getting the vaccine is recommended considering my medical history with cancer. What i will be weighing with my medical team is the benefits of taking the vaccine (even with potential side effects) versus contracting the virus. I assume they will say i should take the vaccine or else live with the risk of experiencing the full effects if i contract covid-19, which, according to antibody testing, i have not contracted already. What are some of the potential side effects of the vaccine? They include pain at the injection site, fatigue, muscle aches or pain, joint pain, headache and fever, which would be short-lived, according to the recent authorization of the vaccine by the fda. Two separate injections are given approximately one month apart. Earlier this year, i was due to receive a vaccine for pneumonia, and i was encouraged to also get a flu shot, which i have not received for almost 10 years. I received both the flu and pneumonia vaccines plus the initial vaccine for shingles, which also is given in two separate injections. I was surprised to learn i could receive all three at the same appointment. My side effects included stomach upset, loss of appetite and a headache that lasted around 24 hours. The benefit is, hopefully, to have few or no problems with pneumonia or the flu and never get shingles. I would hope the covid-19 vaccine would give me the same level of protection, but i will ask if it is known how long potential immunity or partial immunity will last. To be honest, covid-19 worries me because the virus seems to affect lung function along with sometimes causing other unusual symptoms that seem more severe than your typical flu. Read more: the double whammy of cancer and covid-19 on mental healthmy other concerns about not getting vaccinated include being able to get proper medical care and attention during increased demand on the health care system for covid-19 treatments. Also, i worry about getting supportive treatment if i get covid-19 while traveling. I would like to resume a more normal lifestyle in 2021 and get back to traveling and enjoying life more fully. I also see and hear about providers who are getting burned out and are at risk for infection every time they treat a new patient. I do not want to add to that risk. One of my biggest concerns is not wanting to pass covid-19 to someone who might be immunocompromised. I am now ned (no evidence of disease) but still have a higher risk for severe complications because of my asthma. I will feel better about helping to protect the community that i live in if i am vaccinated. I dont look forward to possibly getting ill from a vaccine, but perhaps the payoff will be having fewer negative complications and avoiding hospitalization due to the side effects of covid-19.																
262	1	Why do we need a vaccine for covid-19? How are vaccines developed? And when will a coronavirus vaccine be available? As covid-19 continues to sicken and kill thousands of people around the world, politicians, health professionals and the public are wondering how to get out of lockdown and start to return to normal life. But this wont be simple. Without a vaccine against sars-cov-2- the coronavirus that causes covid-19 - there will always be a risk that new outbreaks of the disease will emerge. While rigorous testing, contact tracing and quarantine procedures will help to control the spread covid-19, the only way to significantly reduce the threat is for enough of the population to become immune to the virus so they cannot pass it on. For this to work, we need around 60% of the population to be immune to the disease. However, as it stands, estimates suggest that only approximately 2-14% of people could currently be immune to coronavirus infection, although this could be higher in some cities. Widespread community immunity (often known as herd immunity) can be achieved either by many people becoming infected - which is extremely risky and costs thousands of lives - or through vaccination. Its no surprise that many politicians and scientists see a covid-19 vaccine as the only safe route back to normality. In this post, take a look at how a coronavirus vaccine will help protect us against covid-19. We review how scientists are developing vaccines against coronavirus so quickly, what progress has been made so far, and how long it will take before a vaccine is ready for widespread use. How do you make a vaccine against coronavirus? Vaccines can be thought of as training programmes for the immune system, teaching your immune cells to recognise and destroy invading bacteria and viruses (pathogens) that cause disease. Most vaccines contain either a small part of a microbe that causes a disease, or a harmless form of the whole pathogen. When the vaccine is injected into your body, your immune system initiates a response without actually making you ill. So, if you go on to encounter the real disease at a later date, youre protected because your body already knows what it looks like and how to deal with it. So far, covid-19 vaccine development has centered around using one particular part of the coronavirus - the spike proteins on the surface - to generate immunity. The sars-cov-2 virus responsible for covid-19 consists of genetic material contained in a membrane littered with spike proteins. The virus binds to and enters cells in your respiratory system using the spikes, then hijacks the cellular machinery to make more copies of itself. Coronavirus structurehow close is a covid-19 vaccine? Research into vaccines for covid-19 has progressed very quickly compared to previous immunisations. Thats thanks to both a global research effort backed by governments and public health organisations, but also a result of using new genetic technologies to rapidly identify potential vaccine candidates. A team of chinese scientists sequenced the virus genetic material and published it on january 12th, kicking off intensive vaccine research and testing all over the world. The first vaccine candidates were ready for pre-clinical testing in animals just weeks later, and a few have already gone into clinical trials in human volunteers. As of april 8th, there were 115 vaccine candidates in development, each with their own strategy for generating immunity. Some rely on injecting the virus spike proteins into the body, or delivering a harmless weakened form of the entire virus. Others use various techniques to deliver genetic material from the virus into your cells, which then make the spike proteins required to generate immunity. When will the coronavirus vaccine be ready? The most important thing for any coronavirus vaccine is that it is safe and effective. Six vaccine candidates have already entered phase i clinical trials in humans, which are designed to test if the vaccines are safe and can trigger an immune response, not whether they are effective in preventing the disease. Further larger trials must show the vaccine offers adequate protection against covid-19. Then, once a vaccine is proven to be safe and effective, it must still conquer the challenges related to scaling up, manufacture and distribution to billions of people all over the world. There is no such thing as a sure thing in vaccine development. At the moment, its not even clear if people become immune to covid-19 after contracting the disease, and if they do, how long immunity lasts. The fact that there are so many candidates in development increases the chances that one or more of them will succeed. Rather than being a race with only one winner, this is more like a penalty shootout with a hundred shots at the goal. Even so, timelines for when we might have a vaccine are uncertain, and with good reason: many promising vaccine candidates fail clinical trials. Some scientists have suggested a vaccine could optimistically be rolled out to some groups later this year, with others saying it will be mid-2021 at the earliest. Will we be stuck in lockdown until we have a vaccine? Until a vaccine is widely available, all we can do is monitor the spread of covid-19 through rigorous monitoring, testing, contact tracing and quarantine or other lockdown restrictions where necessary. Our covid symptom tracker app is a powerful tool for seeing how many people are likely to be infected and where they live, giving policy-makers and healthcare providers the vital data they need to see how well lockdown measures are working and when they might be lifted. And when a vaccine is ready, we can use what we have learned from our app to identify where the vaccine is needed most, who is most at risk, and who should get it first. To sum up: vaccines protect us from disease by giving us immunity without getting sick. They usually contain part of a pathogen causing the disease, which trains our immune systems to protect usthere are more than one hundred coronavirus vaccines in development around the world, with various strategies for generating immunitysome vaccines have reached clinical trials, but have not yet been shown to be safe and effectiveit is likely to take many months to find one or more effective vaccines against covid-19in the absence of a vaccine, how long we will be in lockdown depends on what other steps we take to control the spread of the diseasesymptom tracking is one important way to monitor and contain the spread of covid-19 and ease lockdown restrictions																
263	1	Six reasons why you should get the covid-19 vaccineui health care will offer all employees the opportunity to be vaccinated against covid-19. While it will take time to distribute the vaccines to all 16,000-plus employees, getting vaccinated is essential to maintaining our operations and caring for iowans who need us. As an academic medical center, these are the moments were made for. Not only are we going to be among the first to start vaccinations in iowa, but we were also one of the clinical trial sites for the pfizer-biontech vaccine. This is an exciting time. If youre not yet convinced or youre feeling uncertain, here are six simple reasons to consider.1. Keep yourself safe and healthythe first covid-19 vaccine in the state of iowa was administered at ui health care at 9:42 a. M. On dec. 14 to emergency room nurse david conway, rn. Perhaps one of the most obvious reasons is to keep yourself healthy. Receiving the covid-19 vaccine provides you with protection against the virus, keeping you healthy.2. The initial vaccines are proving (very) effectivethe two leading vaccine candidates, pfizer and moderna, have been shown to be about 95% effective, which is very good. The initial goal to be considered for fda emergency use approval was at least 50% effective.3. Clinical trials have validated the safety of the vaccinesthe covid-19 vaccines, like other drugs and biologics released in the u. S. , must go through multiple phases of rigorous testing, analysis, and review. In fact, the clinical trials for the covid-19 enrolled far more participants than other vaccine trials. The u. S. Food and drug administration (fda) closely monitors the vaccine development process and testing results for efficacy and safety. As part of the fdas formal process to determine if the vaccine is approved for public use, it also seeks a recommendation from a multidisciplinary team of experts consisting of independent medical officers, microbiologists, chemists, biostatisticians, and other health experts. The fda continues to oversee the vaccine and its manufacturing following approval to ensure its ongoing safety. Read more.4. Be the leaders we know we arehealth care personnel have been prioritized in the first phase of vaccinations in the united states. By leading the way of being the first vaccinated, we lead the next phase of recovery for our community. Health care workers have the unique opportunity to demonstrate to the public the important of immediate vaccination.5. Be here for our patientsmost importantly, it allows us to continue to be there for each other and our patients.6. Return to life as normal (or at least more social)a vaccine is the best and only way to return to life as normal, or closer to what it was before covid-19. While it will take some time to roll out vaccines to all of ui heath care, all iowans, and globally, every individual vaccinated is a step in the right direction. And we all need to continue to follow our safety precautions for a long time to come.

He cited the words of belgian vaccinologist geert vanden bossche, who advised against covid-19 vaccines. Because vaccinal [antibodies] suppress relevant innate [antibodies], these vaccines have no capacity whatsoever to confer sterilizing immunity. Moreover, vaccinal [antibodies] tend to outcompete innate [antibodies] for binding to sars-cov-2 because of their higher affinity for the virus, vanden bossche said back in december 2021. This particularly applies to naive innate [antibodies in children] and already explains why [covid-19] vaccination is at risk of dramatically weakening peoples first line of immune defense, especially in children. The belgian expert warned that mass vaccination against covid-19 is an assault on [peoples] immune system that carries dramatic consequences for both individual and public health. He reiterated that natural immunity is well-armed to protect against all covid-19 variants and other viruses responsible for causing acute respiratory disease. Mass vaccination is now turning covid-19 into a disease of young and healthy unvaccinated people, while enabling the virus to break through both the innate and adaptive immune defense of vaccines. Verkerk, also the executive director of anh, cited the rise of vaccine-induced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (vaids), which he dubbed as the puzzle piece that connects potential immune erosion with hiv [human immunodeficiency virus]. He warned: with increasing frequency of exposure of people to covid-19 injections that erode innate immunity and disrupt cell-mediated immune responses, it is highly likely we will witness a rise in vaids [cases. ] it may be longer before health authorities and vaccine manufacturers who have pushed to achieve incredibly high rates of vaccine coverage in many industrialized countries are prepared to recognize that the injections are the cause. (related: doctors are testifying that covid-19 vaccines are giving people cancer and aids. ) verkerk explores link between hiv and covid the anh founder referenced a february 2020 paper by french scientist and mathematician jean claude perez about the sars-cov-2 pathogen. Using computer simulation, he found genome fragments of two retrovirus variants  the hiv and the simian immunodeficiency virus (siv)  in the reference genome of the original sars-cov-2 that emerged from the huanan seafood market in wuhan. Perez argued that these viruses would be unlikely to find their way either to a bat cave or an animal, living or dead, in the wuhan market. A later study involving perez and the late professor jean-luc montagnier elaborated on the february 2020 observations findings. The pairs july 2020 paper published in the international journal of research pointed out that 2.5 percent of the sars-cov-2 genome from wuhan contained 18 rna fragment insertions from either siv or hiv. Given that the fragments were 18 to 30 nucleotides in length, perez and montagnier argued that these had the ability to modify gene expression in humans exposed to the pathogen that causes covid-19. According to the french researchers, the rna inserts were likely inserted in the virus for a twofold purpose  for gain-of-function research and vaccine design. True enough, verkerk mentioned that two covid-19 vaccines in clinical trials had links to hiv. According to the anh founder, the chinese cansino and russian sputnik v shots are two such vaccines that use the genetically engineered adenovirus type-5 vector (ad5) to deliver the sars-cov-2 spike protein. However, a trial of an hiv vaccine in the 2000s that used ad5 found that it increased the risk of hiv infection in the vaccinated cohort. Montagnier died on feb. 8 at the age of 89. But before his death, a quote attributed to him became viral: for those of you who have taken the third [covid-19 vaccine] dose, go and take a test for aids. The results may surprise you.

265	0	Covid-19 vaccines used to kill people in what is shaping to be the largest genocide in history 04/01/2022 / by mary villareal numerous intel briefings from military and scientific experts showed that the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccines are bioweapons that deliver payloads for mass genocide and dehumanization. Crispr technology is being used to alter human genes, and they have graphene oxide as hardware to get inside the body. In a clip from the dr. Jane ruby show, the host said people are being injected with hardware and repeated injections are bringing software under the guise of helping people avoid what is essentially the flu. A german researcher said his team is working on a transporter system to deliver payloads supposedly for targeting and delivering medications to difficult places in the body. Graphene microbubbles are used as transporters, but the payload could be anything else. It could be drugs, gene signals through modified rna synthetic strands or unknown chemicals and entities that are likely designed to be deployed later. Numerous scientists behind the scenes are also concerned that some of the entities can be programed for later: in months, even years. Vaccine manufacturers are also testing to see how people are tolerating them physically, maybe even mentally. Ruby also said there had been people emailing her about the effect of the vaccines, making them more aggressive and short-tempered. While ruby noted that she didnt really have a response to these observations as they are not scientific, she did mention that the number of queries she received has been more frequent. She also mentioned the presence of carbon nanotubes that engage with peoples brains and short-circuit them. Its all boiling down to three focal points. Mass genocide, building and controlling hybrid people from within and thirdly, inserting and testing circuitry in humans, ruby said. She also shared that there is a particular theory emerging that indicates there are many different components to this bioweapon that must be injected at different time points in an effort to mimic biochemical reaction, to make the weapon as close to what the body would normally do. Essentially, what is happening in the body is that there are multiple programs going on at once. First is distributing graphene intra-body for future circuitry. The graphene flagship project has been given billions of dollars worldwide to develop all kinds of sub-technology. (related: robert f. Kennedy jr. Warns that fauci, gates are committing mass genocide against humanity. ) it plays a role in circuitry, in possibly one of the components, or part of the components in the lipid nano transporter that moves the synthetic mrna into different cells in the human body. The second program that is happening is the use of multiple hiv proteins. It is being postulated to disarm a persons immune system and weaken it. The third program is the use of covid boosters, which are being forced on people. Genocidal globalist dr. Mylo canderian recently became popular on social media because of his genocidal views. It is still not clear if hes a true person or just a fictional character, but many call him the genocidal globalist because hes supposedly very supportive of klaus schwab and the great reset. Canderian follows the precept ten of the georgia guidestones that posits there should only be half a billion people on the planet. The georgia guidestones are granite monuments erected over four decades ago in elbert county, georgia. It sets ten guidelines, the first of which states: maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature. It is canderians opinion that 95 percent of the worlds population are useless eaters who need to be euthanized as quickly as possible. He is confident that the vaccines will put an end to the human cancer upon the earth. The graphene oxide in vaccines plays a huge role in that. Any hematologist could see within seconds under a microscope the percentage of blood affected or contaminated by graphene oxide, which shows the end of cycle calculation. To illustrate, a vaccinated person who has 20 percent graphene oxide deterioration in their blood will live for eight years (10 years less 20 percent). A person with 70 percent graphene oxide deterioration, meanwhile, will not live more than three years. In canderians viewpoint, it is easy. Let them all die. (related: as covid injections spread autoimmune disease and vaids, media pivots to incoming aids vaccine that will only accelerate the vaccine genocide. ) the more shots and boosters the imbeciles get, the worse their blood will look under a microscope, and the quicker they will turn to fertilizer, he said.																
266	0	A shocking 15 fully vaxxed tennis players withdraw from miami open due to serious health issues 04/05/2022 / by lance d johnson some of the worlds top athletes are either collapsing on the field/court or becoming too weak to play their favorite sport. At the miami open, 15 fully-vaccinated players withdrew during the competition, leaving spectators baffled. Some of the crowds favorites had to leave the competition early, including paula badosa from spain and jannik sinner from italy. They retired from their quarterfinal contests on the same day. Earlier, rafael nadal had to leave the court for treatment after experiencing chest pain during his match against taylor fritz in the indian wells final. He was able to continue, but was clearly struggling with his breathing as the unheralded fritz completed an upset and handed nadal his first loss this season. All three players succumbed to the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccine mandate imposed by the australian open in 2021. Their health has apparently deteriorated since then. It was the australian open that banned well-informed, unvaccinated players from the sport. The number one mens player, novak djokovic, faced discrimination for choosing not to partake in this forceful experiment. Although djokovic was persecuted, at least his heart, brain and immune system can still function normally. Despite being slandered and discriminated against, he can still play his favorite sport with dignity and has retained authority over his health and body autonomy. Even the corporate media is reporting on the medical anomalies. Yahoo sports published an article titled, whats going on: tennis world stunned after miami open carnage. During the miami open, five fully-vaxxed men had to retire from the competition. They include matt moraing (germany), holger rune (denmark), jan-lennard struff (germany), reilly opelka (united states) and sinner. There was a total of 10 women (also fully vaxxed) who had to withdraw. They include maryna zanevska (belgium), caroline garcia (france), clara tauson (denmark), dalma galfi (hungary), anna kalinskaya (russia), karolina muchova (czech republic), katerina siniakova (czech republic), victoria azarenka (belarus), anhelina kalinina (ukraine) and badosa. Fully-vaxxed cyclists and swimmers are collapsing, too its not just tennis players who are experiencing chest pains, myocarditis, strokes, syncope and shortness of breath after receiving these bioweapon vaccines. The tour de france, which spans 2,068 miles, hosts the worlds best cyclists. In its 118-year history, only a single cyclist suddenly collapsed on the course due to health reasons. In 2022, this all changed as three professional cyclists suddenly collapsed with cardiac events. Two of the cyclists died. The first person fatally affected was john paul (scotland), who passed away on march 9, 2022. After becoming the junior sprint champion in 2011, paul represented scotland at the 2010 and 2014 commonwealth games. He was taken out at the age of 28. The second professional cyclist affected was cedric baekeland (belgium). He complained of chest discomfort after training with his team on the spanish island of mallorca. He was taken out on march 14, 2022 at the age of 28. The third event involved sonny colbrelli, who suffered a cardiac event after crossing the finish line of the volta a catalunya in spain. The italian cyclist was saved with a defibrillator but may never play again due to permanent cardiovascular damage. A 23-year-old water polo player from romania suffered a similar fate. During a live game, andrei dr? Ghici suddenly left the pool and suffered a heart attack. All resuscitation efforts failed and an hour later, he was pronounced dead. The official covid narrative is dissipating because many vaccinated people are going through hell. Young, healthy people are collapsing with heart attacks because the so-called vaccine causes blood clots and inflammation of the heart. The leader of the free world and several members of the u. S. Congress are cognitively impaired and pushing for their fourth and soon to be fifth dose of an obviously failed and dangerous vaccine program. These crimes against humanity must come to an end.																
267	0	Dr. Peter mccullough says 30% of vaccinated pilots would fail health screenings because of vaccine injuries 04/26/2022 / by kevin hughes well-known cardiologist dr. Peter mccullough told u. S. Freedom flyers co-founder joshua yoder that many airline pilots would fail health screenings due to vaccine-induced heart conditions. Yoder, an airline pilot himself, shared his conversation with mccullough in an april 20 interview with vaccine safety research foundation founder and tech millionaire steve kirsch. He [mccullough] said that if every vaccinated pilot were to be screened, there would be somewhere around a 30 percent loss in manpower, yoder said. (related: covid-19 vaccine mandates for airline pilots increase the risks of flying) mccullough, along with idaho pathologist dr. Ryan cole, robert kennedy jr. , lt. Col teresa long, lt. Col. Peter chambers, signed a letter addressed to the federal aviation administration (faa) and major airlines on december 15, 2021, persuading them to flag all vaccinated pilots and conduct ekgs, d-dimer tests, troponin tests and cardiac mris to evaluate their health. According to yoder, the most prominent health issues being reported by pilots injected with the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccines include chest pains, myocarditis and pericarditis. He mentioned that three vaccinated pilots told him that they are currently flying with chest pains and another one said he is being treated by a cardiologist. The u. S. Freedom flyers co-founder noted that the pilots want to remain anonymous because they dont want to lose their jobs. Yoder said his group would like to find a solution for these pilots and collaborate with doctors, the faa, airlines and unions to come up with a protocol that could give airline pilots some kind of immunity and allow them to speak openly about their conditions. The u. S. Freedom flyers, an all-volunteer group of americas transportation professionals, was formed last fall to assist employees in the air transportation industry fight the federal laws about vaccinations. Im afraid if we keep going down this path, at some point its going to end in catastrophe. If passengers actually knew what was going on at the airlines and the faa, they would be livid, and everyone would be jumping on a class action suit against all of them, yoder said. Doctors give warning about adverse events from covid-19 vaccine many doctors have warned that adverse events from the covid-19 vaccination could cause a pilot (to lose) control of his aircraft and bring untold devastation. As american greatness reported, an american airlines pilot suffered a cardiac arrest six minutes after landing his airbus plane at the dallas-fort worth airport. Yoder said captain robert snow nearly died when his heart stopped on april 9. They had to shock him three times with the aed [automated external defibrillator] to bring him back, yoder related. Snow was taken to baylor, scott and white health center, which is only ten minutes from both american airlines and the union (the allied pilots association), yet nobody from the airline or union contacted snow while he was in the hospital, or stopped by to visit him. The only thing the airline did was fly his family to the hospital to meet with him. Yoder said it is pretty clear that snows cardiac arrest was caused by the johnson & johnson vaccine, but the pilot has been going through a series of tests to confirm it. Snow called the u. S. Freedom flyers for assistance and the group put together a world-class team of doctors and lawyers to help him. Yoder said that snow is now recuperating at home. Apparently, yoder said, the airline industry does not want to deal with the issue. American airlines is trying to create as much distance between themselves and this incident as humanely possible. So is the faa, and so are the unions. We cant even get a response, yoder said. Yoder stated that snow would be speaking out soon, and when he does youre going to hear some very interesting details that are going to be very damning for american airlines, the allied pilots association, the faa and everyone else involved. He also mentioned two other pilots who have come forward to speak about their vaccine injuries. Pilot greg pierson has spoken out against the covid vaccines ever since he suffered a stroke after getting the jab under pressure last year. Pierson stated during an interview last december that if he had the stroke while piloting a plane, he could have caused a crash. Cody flint, on the other hand, was an agricultural pilot up until he got the jab in february 2021. A few days after his vaccination, flint said he suffered a mid-flight blackout before landing safely only by the grace of god. Flint was diagnosed with a neurological disorder that caused him his career. Hes suffering from harsh headaches and vertigo because of his condition and has had multiple surgeries and numerous doctor visits. Follow vaccineinjurynews.

268	0	Teens develop heart damage months after getting second pfizer covid shot, study finds 04/02/2022 / by ethan huff new research published in the journal of pediatrics reveals that more than 66 percent of all adolescents who develop wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccine-related myopericarditis after the second jab still end up suffering from persistent heart abnormalities months after their initial diagnosis. This revelation suggests that, contrary to what the government claims, fauci flu shot adverse effects can be long term, even in children. And the saddest part is that children have a zero percent risk of dying from the disease in the first place, so what is the rationale behind them getting the shots? Published on march 25, the study challenges the position held by multiple government agencies in the united states, including the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) which claims that heart inflammation caused by pfizer and moderna mrna (messenger rna) injections is always mild. Researchers at seattle childrens hospital looked at cases of younger patients under age 18 who came to the hospital with chest pain and elevated serum troponin levels between april 1, 2021, and jan. 7, 2022, which covers the height of the operation warp speed mass injection campaign. All of them had received their second dose of pfizer within the previous week. Of the 35 patients who fit the criteria, 16 were determined to be suitable for evaluation purposes. All 16 underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (mri) tests three to eight months after their first examination. Of these, 11 were found to have persistent late gadolinium enhancement (lge), though levels were lower than in previous months. The presence of lge is an indicator of cardiac injury and fibrosis and has been strongly associated with worse prognosis in patients with classical acute myocarditis, the study explains. Fully vaccinated children have troponin levels more than 20 times higher than a heart attack patient a meta-analysis of eight studies found that lge is a predictor of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, cardiac transplant, rehospitalizations, recurrent acute myocarditis, and is a requirement for mechanical circulatory support. Another 11-study meta-analysis found the presence and extent of lge to be a significant predictor of adverse cardiac outcomes. While some of the child patients in the new study showed symptoms that were transient and most patients appeared to respond to treatment, there was still a persistence of abnormal findings, the team found. All of this rais[es] concerns for potential longer-term effects, the researchers wrote, adding that they plan to take more mris at the one year mark to see whether any of the abnormalities have resolved. The paper provides more evidence that myocarditis in adolescents that result from covid-19 vaccines is very serious, says dr. Madhava setty, the senior science editor for the defender, a project of childrens health defense (chd). All patients had significantly elevated serum troponin levels indicative of heart damage. And lge, which is indicative of poor outcome, was present in more than two-thirds of the kids. These young patients had a median troponin level of 9.15  more than 20 times greater than the levels found in people suffering heart attacks. Commenting on the findings on twitter, dr. Marty makary, a surgeon and public policy researcher at johns hopkins university, wrote that the cdc has a civic duty to rigorously study the long-term effects of vaccine-induced myocarditis. New follow-up study 3-8 months after myocarditis shows the mri heart abnormality of late gadolinium enhancement seen in 63% of children, he added. Merits further study. According to dr. Anisha koka, a cardiologist, the study also suggests that upwards of 70 percent of teenagers who develop myocarditis from covid injections will be left with a scar on their heart.

Com vaccine injury news com vaccineinjurynews	autismtruthnews	thimerosal	vaccines search search girls are developing genital ulcers after getting the pfizer covid-19 vaccine 04/11/2022 / by arsenio toledo young girls, some as young as five years old, are developing genital ulcers due to pfizers wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) mrna vaccine. This is according to published peer-reviewed articles and data from the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers), the federal governments program for collecting reports about adverse events related to vaccinations. (related: recently released pfizer documents show mrna covid-19 vaccine can cause 1,291 different adverse events. ) one of the recently published medical journal articles talking about the post-vaccine genital ulcers was published this month in the journal of pediatric and adolescent gynecology. The study, titled post covid-19 vaccination vulvar aphthous ulcers: an unpopular case series, was conducted by three doctors in the pediatric and adolescent gynecology department at mercy childrens hospital in kansas, missouri. With the covid-19 pandemic, our institution saw covid-associated aphthous ulcers, wrote the study authors. After increased use of the pfizer vaccine in those 12 years old and over, our institution also saw a series of post-vaccination aphthous ulcers. The doctors studied three girls, aged 12 to 15, who presented with vaginal ulcers that began developing less than three days after they got the second dose of pfizers mrna covid-19 vaccine. Each of the girls received the first dose of the vaccine without complications. But all three, within the second day after they got the second dose, started experiencing pain in the genitals. All three children were brought to mercy childrens hospital between june to september 2021 and were diagnosed with vulvar aphthous lesions. Also known as lipschutz ulcers, this condition is a very rare, non-sexually acquired condition that even the smartest gynecologists in the world know very little about. Its main symptom is large deep ulcers forming in female genitals. It also causes pain, malaise and fever. Each of the girls suffered multiple large ulcers on their genitals, some of which became necrotic. None of them were sexually active or had prior covid-19 infection or even recent exposure. Girls as young as five can also develop genital ulcers after pfizer vaccination many other studies prove that the pfizer vaccine is giving girls genital ulcers. In wisconsin, a healthy 12-year-old girl with no prior sexual history developed a fever a day after she got the second dose of the covid-19 vaccine. A day later, she developed three painful ulcers on her genitals, one of which was necrotic. In childrens minnesota, a 16-year-old girl with no prior sexual history became feverish, fatigued and experienced muscle pain within 24 hours after she got her second pfizer covid-19 vaccine. She later developed lesions in her vaginal area. Over the next two days, the lesions on the right side of her vaginal area turned into one large oozing yellow and gray ulcer with necrotic parts that caused her immense pain. In colorado, a five-year-old girl got the second dose of pfizers deadly covid-19 vaccine back in november. Within a day, she developed muscle aches, arm pain and a vaginal lesion which made it difficult to walk. This case was reported to vaers and it was unresolved.

270	0	Uk government refuses to publish further covid-19 data because it suggests the triple vaccinated are developing aids & the double vaccinated are suffering ade 04/19/2022 / by news editors the uk health security agency is refusing to publish any further data on covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status because previous figures show that the triple vaccinated population are on the verge of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and the double vaccinated are suffering antibody-dependent enhancement. (article republished from dailyexpose. Uk) back in october 2021, the expose exclusively revealed how the uk health security agency (ukhsa) data was showing that the covid-19 injections has a real-world effectiveness against infection of minus-109%. Not long after this, the ukhsa added a note to their reports stating case rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations should not be used to estimate vaccine effectiveness against covid-19 infection this was clearly done in response to our report, and also because they could no longer use their own data to show that the covid-19 injections are effective. But it was perfectly okay when pfizer used this exact method to falsely claim their mrna covid-19 injection was 95% effective of course. Now, as we quietly predicted, the ukhsa have gone one step further, and have announced that they will no longer publish the number of covid-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths by vaccine status. The reason? The ukhsa claims this is because the uk government has ended free universal covid-19 testing and this therefore affects their ability to robustly monitor covid-19 cases by vaccination status. However, this doesnt explain why theyre no longer able to publish the data on covid hospitalisations and deaths. If someone is hospitalised with covid-19 then were pretty sure the doctors and nurses are going to know about it, and if someone dies of covid-19 were pretty sure a doctor is going to know about it. Theres a good reason though as to why their excuse falls short, and its because they are lying. The uk health security agency has been looking for an excuse for months to stop publishing the data because it clearly shows that the triple vaccinated population are on the cusp of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids), and the double vaccinated population are suffering vaccine-associated enhanced disease (vaed) and antibody-dependent enhancement (ade). The evidence the ukhsa claims that vaccine effectiveness wanes substantially over time and this is why its important to get a booster dose. But this is a lie. Vaccine effectiveness doesnt wane. Immune system performance does. Vaccine effectiveness isnt really a measure of a vaccine, it is a measure of a vaccine recipients immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person. Vaccines allegedly help develop immunity by imitating an infection. Once the imitation infection induced by the vaccine goes away, the body is left with a supply of memory t-cells and antibodies that will remember how to fight that disease in the future. So, when the authorities state that the effectiveness of the vaccines weaken over time, what they really mean is that the performance of your immune system weakens over time. A vaccine effectiveness of -50% would mean that immune system of the vaccinated is now performing at a worse rate than the natural immune system of the unvaccinated. It would mean the covid-19 vaccines have damaged the immune system. With that being said it should come as no surprise to anyone as to why the ukhsa no longer wish to publish the covid-19 data by vaccination status, because it clearly shows in all areas that the covid-19 injections are proving to have a negative vaccine effectiveness that is declining by the week, and therefore a negative immune system performance, which implies the fully vaccinated are developing covid-19 vaccine induced acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The following table showing the number of cases by vaccination status between week 9 and week 12 of 2022, is taken from the ukhsa week 13  2022  vaccine surveillance report, the very last report to contain figures on covid-19 by vaccination status  as you can see from the above, the triple vaccinated population accounted for the majority of covid-19 cases in each age group by an extremely concerning amount, except for the under 18s. The highest number of cases in those four weeks was recorded among triple jabbed 50-59-year olds, with 210,265 confirmed cases. This compares to just 7,669 cases among unvaccinated 50-59-year-olds. The ukhsa also used to conveniently provide the case-rates per 100,000 individuals by vaccination status in their vaccine surveillance reports, and the following table has been stitched together from the case-rate tables found in the week 3, week 7 and week 13 vaccine surveillance reports  as you can see from the above the case-rates per 100k have been highest among the triple vaccinated population over these 3 months, except for the 18-29-year-olds in the week 3 report only, and the under 18s in all 3 months. However, it is worth noting the rapid decline in rates among unvaccinated children compared to the small decline in rates among vaccinated children. This suggests that in just a few weeks the case rate will be highest among triple jabbed kids. But now well never know because the ukhsa is hiding it. Now that we know the case-rates we can use pfizers simple vaccine effectiveness formula to calculate the real-world covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated. Unvaccinated case rate  vaccinated case rate / unvaccinated case rate x 100 the following chart shows the covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population in england in the week 3, week 7 and week 13 reports of 2022  this is nowhere near the claimed 95% effectiveness by pfizer is it? As you can clearly see the vaccine effectiveness has been falling month on month, with the lowest effectiveness recorded among 60-69-year-olds at a shocking minus-391%. This age group has experienced the sharpest decline, falling from minus-104.69% in week 3. But one of the more concerning declines in vaccine effectiveness has been recorded among 18-29-year-olds, falling to minus-231% by week 12 of 2022 from +10.19% in week 3. However, vaccine effectiveness isnt really a measure of a vaccine, it is a measure of a vaccine recipients immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person. Using the case rates provided by ukhsa, we can also calculate the immune system performance. All we need to do is alter the vaccine effectiveness formula slightly for a negative immune system performance, and use the same formula for a positive immune system performance  positive immune system performance = unvaccinated case rate  vaccinated case rate / unvaccinated case rate x 100 negative immune system performance = unvaccinated case rate  vaccinated case rate / vaccinated case rate x 100 the following chart shows the immune system performance of the triple vaccinated population in england by age group in four week periods, compared to the natural immune system of the unvaccinated population  the lowest immune system performance is currently among 60-69-year-olds at a shocking minus-80%, but all triple vaccinated people aged 30 to 59 are not far behind, with an immune system performance ranging from minus-75% to minus-76%. Even the 18 to 29-year-olds are within this region at minus-70%, falling from an immune system performance of +11.35% between week 51 and week 2, meaning they have suffered the fastest decline in immune system performance. Aids (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged. People with acquired immune deficiency syndrome are at an increased risk for developing certain cancers and for infections that usually occur only in individuals with a weak immune system. If that immune system performance was to hit around the -95% mark then this would strongly suggest the triple vaccinated population have developed some new form of covid-19 vaccine induced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and unfortunately based on the current trend seen over the past 3 months, the youngest age groups do not have long to wait. But we wont be able to officially confirm it because the uk health security agency have decided to sweep it under the carpet and hide the official data. That isnt the only terrible outcome that the ukhsa are attempting to conceal though. Because ukhsa data also suggests the double vaccinated are suffering antibody-dependent enhancement. Antibody-dependent enhancement the ukhsa have been trying to hide this revelation since the turn of the year, when they decided to stop publishing the rates per 100,000 for the double jabbed and instead only publish the rates for the triple jabbed. The rates are calculated by dividing the total population size of each vaccination status group by 100,000; and then dividing the total number of cases, hospitalisations or deaths among each vaccinated group by the calculated figure. E. G.  3 million double vaccinated / 100k = 30 500,000 cases among double vaccinated / 30 = 16,666.66 cases per 100,000 population. Questions were raised at the time as to why the ukhsa decided to stop publishing the rates for the double vaccinated, mainly because in the weeks prior they were beginning to look terrible for the double vaccinated population. But, as is usually the case, the ukhsa never provided a reason. However, the ukhsa produces a separate report containing the overall population size by age group and vaccination status, meaning we can take these figures and actually calculate the case, hospitalisation and death rates per 100,000 among the double vaccinated ourselves. Heres the table taken from the week 12 influenza and covid-19 surveillance report  the following chart shows the actual double vaccinated population size by age group on the 20th march 2022, based on the figures provided by ukhsa above  now that we know the population size all we have to do is divide each population by 100,000; and then divide the number of cases, hospitalisations and deaths by the answer to that equation, to calculate the case, hospitalisation and death rates. The following chart shows the covid-19 hospitalisation rate per 100,000 individuals by vaccination status between 28th feb and 27th march 22. The unvaccinated case rate has been taken from page 45 of the ukhsa vaccine surveillance report  week 13  2022, and the double vaccinated case rate has been calculated with the number of hospitalisations provided on page 41 of the same report  the rates per 100,000 are highest among the double vaccinated in every age group except for the 18-29-year-olds. This data shows that all double vaccinated people aged 30 and over are more likely to be hospitalised with covid-19 than unvaccinated people. The following chart shows the covid-19 death rate per 100,000 individuals by vaccination status between 28th feb and 27th march 22. The unvaccinated case rate has been taken from page 45 of the ukhsa vaccine surveillance report  week 13  2022, and the double vaccinated case rate has been calculated with the number of deaths provided on page 44 of the same report  the death-rate per 100,000 is highest among the double vaccinated in all age groups excluding the 30-39 year olds where the death rate is the same as the unvaccinated, and the 18-29-year-olds where the death rate is lower. This data shows that all double vaccinated people aged 40 and over are more likely to die of covid-19 than unvaccinated people. If the rates per 100,000 are higher among the vaccinated, which they are, then this means the covid-19 injections are proving to have a negative effectiveness in the real-world. And by using pfizers vaccine effectiveness formula we can accurately decipher what the real world effectiveness among each age group actually is. Pfizers vaccine formula: unvaccinated rate per 100k  vaccinated rate per 100k / unvaccinated rate per 100k x 100 = vaccine effectiveness the following chart shows the real world covid-19 vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation among the double vaccinated population in england, based on the hospitalisation rates provided above  this data shows that all double vaccinated people over age 30 are between 0.2 and 2 times more likely to be hospitalised, with a minus-1% vaccine effectiveness among 30 to 39 year olds, and a minus-76% vaccine effectiveness among the over 80s. The following chart shows the real world covid-19 vaccine effectiveness against death among the double vaccinated population in england, based on the death rates provided above  this data shows that all double vaccinated people over age 40 are between 2 and 3 times more likely to die of covid-19, with a minus-90% vaccine effectiveness among 30 to 39 year olds, and a minus-156% vaccine effectiveness among the over 80s. But why are most double vaccinated people more likely to be hospitalised, and more likely to die of covid-19 than unvaccinated people? Vaccine-associated enhanced disease intensive research conducted by health experts throughout the years has brought to light increasing concerns about antibody-dependent enhancement (ade), a phenomenon where vaccines make the disease far worse by priming the immune system for a potentially deadly overreaction. Ade can arise in several different ways but the best-known is dubbed the trojan horse pathway. This occurs when non-neutralizing antibodies generated by past infection or vaccination fail to shut down the pathogen upon re-exposure. Instead, they act as a gateway by allowing the virus to gain entry and replicate in cells that are usually off limits (typically immune cells, like macrophages). That, in turn, can lead to wider dissemination of illness, and over-reactive immune responses that cause more severe illness. Of the information collated by pfizer so far from the ongoing study they have conducted, it is plain to see that they are fully aware antibody-dependent enhancement is a possible consequence of their covid-19 injection, and it looks like they may even know the consequence has killed people. Pfizer, the company hit with the largest healthcare fraud settlement and criminal fine to date in 2009; which also happens to be the same company behind the first every mrna gene therapy injection administered to the general public under emergency use authorisation in the name of covid-19, has admitted in confidential documents, that it desperately tried to keep from going public, that its covid-19 mrna gene therapy may cause vaccine-associated enhanced disease. The us food and drug administration (fda) attempted to delay the release of pfizers covid-19 vaccine safety data for 75 years despite approving the injection after only 108 days of safety review on december 11th, 2020. But in early january 2022, federal judge mark pittman ordered them to release 55,000 pages per month. They released 12,000 pages by the end of january. Since then, phmpt has posted all of the documents to their website. The latest drop happened on 1st april 22. One of the documents contained in the latest data dump is reissue_5.3.6 postmarketing experience. Pdf. Table 5, found on page 11 of the document shows an important potential risk, and that risk is listed as vaccine-associated enhanced disease (vaed), including vaccine-associated enhanced reporatory disease (vaerd). Vaccine-associated enhanced diseases (vaed) are modified presentations of clinical infections affecting individuals exposed to a wild-type pathogen after having received a prior vaccination for the same pathogen. Enhanced responses are triggered by failed attempts to control the infecting virus, and vaed typically presents with symptoms related to the target organ of the infection pathogen. According to scientists vaed occurs as two different immunopathologies, antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) and vaccine-associated hypersensitivity (vah). Pfizer claim in their confidential document that up to 28th feb 2021, they had received 138 cases reporting 317 potentially relevant events indicative of vaccine-associated enhanced disease. Of these 71 were medically signifiant resulting in 8 disabilities, 13 were life-threatening events, and 38 of the 138 people died. Of the 317 relevant events reported by 138 people, 135 were labelled as drug ineffective, 53 were labelled as dysponoea (struggling to breathe), 23 were labelled as covid-19 pneumonia, 8 were labelled as respiratory failure, and 7 were labelled as seizure. Pfizer also admitted that 75 of the 101 subjects with confirmed covid-19 following vaccination, had severe disease resulting in hospitalisation, disability, life-threatening consequences of death. But pfizer still definitively concluded, for the purposes of their submitted safety data to the food and drug administration, the very data that was needed to gain emergency use authorisation and make them billions and billions of dollars, that none of the 75 cases could be definitively considered as vaed. But pfizer then went on to confirm that based on the current evidence, vaed remains a theoretical risk. This confidential data proves that the covid-19 injections should never have been granted emergency use authorisation, and should have been pulled from distribution by the fda as soon as they sighted the figures. But the fda failed to act, and that is precisely why the uk health security agency has been looking for, and found an inadequate excuse not to publish any further data on covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status.

271	0	540 athletes die after receiving covid injections, hundreds more develop serious health conditions 04/13/2022 / by kevin hughes the so-called health professionals pushing for the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccine programs around the globe have repeatedly said the vaccines are safe and effective. But hundreds of young and healthy athletes are dying because of them. The liberty daily reported: just as weve noted for several months, most major sports have been hit with inexplicable medical conditions popping up in young and otherwise healthy athletes, including our report that three cyclists fell in march alone. As of the end of march, the good sciencing website has recorded 833 athletes worldwide who had cardiac arrests or other serious issues  with 540 confirmed deaths post-covid vaccination. (related: why are covid outbreaks still happening in professional sports if the athletes are all vaccinated? ) post-vaccination injuries in athletes include cardiac arrest, blood clots or thrombosis, stroke, irregular heartbeat, arrhythmia and neuropathy. Good sciencing is made up of a small team of investigators, news editors, journalists and truth-seekers who are collecting pieces of information that they can investigate. It doesnt really matter who we are. What really matters is that we care carrying on an investigation and were presenting the evidence weve found, almost all of it documented in mainstream media publications. Were doing this anonymously because weve seen people viciously attacked and threatened for doing things like this, so were not going to open ourselves or any of our contacts to that, good sciencing said on its website. In addition to receiving new cases and updates from alert readers, good sciencing reported that they are also receiving hate mails and death threats. Young athletes having major medical issues good sciencing has provided a non-exhaustive and continuously growing list of mainly young athletes who had major medical issues in 2021 and 2022 after receiving one or more covid shots. Initially, many of these were not reported. We know that many people were told not to tell anyone about their adverse reactions and the media was not reporting them. They started happening and ramping up after the first covid vaccinations. The mainstream media still are not reporting most, but sports news cannot ignore the fact that soccer players and other stars collapse in the middle of a game due to a sudden cardiac arrest. Many of those die  more than 50 percent, good sciencing revealed. Most, if not all of these athletes have suffered heart problems after covid vaccines. At the time of initial writing, 28 died. That was not normal, but then, 10 days later, 56 deaths were listed, and the numbers are climbing. Any other real vaccine would have been pulled off the market long before now. The media would be asking questions. They would be pressuring governments. But they are not. And governments continue running tv and radio and newspaper ads encouraging people to get their first, second, third, fourth shot. Good sciencing added that many posts on facebook, instagram, twitter, forums and news stories are being removed. So now we are receiving some messages saying there is no proof of the event or of vaccination status. That is partly because this information is being hidden, good sciencing said. More people are writing to tell us that in many cases, we didnt mention a persons vaccination status. There is a good reason for that. None of the clubs want to reveal this information. None of their sponsors want to reveal it. The players have been told not to reveal it. Most of their relatives will not mention it. None of the media are asking this question. The daily mail reported on january 28 that sunderland fc manager lee johnson implied the covid injection could be behind his goalkeeper lee burge being ruled out of playing with an inflamed heart and said it happens a lot after these injections. Two days later the club confirmed that johnson had been sacked. The 29-year-old burge will be out of action for the league one side for up to five weeks because of his condition. Form your own conclusions as to why the club would sack the manager who cares about his players, good sciencing said. We know there is a concerted worldwide effort to make this information go away, so that fact alone tells us it must be collected, investigated and saved so other researchers can look at it to see if there are any useful patterns. We really appreciate the athletes named in this list who have confirmed what happened to them so the truth can be known. They care about their fellow athletes, even if the clubs, their sponsors, media and politicians care more about money. Follow vaccineinjurynews.

272	0	No one is safe: vaccinated individuals can transmit graphene to the unvaccinated 04/19/2022 / by kevin hughes biomedical clinics medical director dr. Philippe van welbergen revealed that the graphene being injected into people is assembling and developing into larger fibers and structures, getting magnetic properties or an electrical charge. The fibers are also displaying indications of more complex structures with streaks. He also showed that shards of graphene are being transmitted from vaccinated to unvaccinated people, and it is destroying the red blood cells and causing blood clots in the unvaccinated. Van welbergen was one of the first to warn the public of the damage the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) injections was causing to peoples blood by publishing images last year of blood samples under the microscope. In july 2021, van welbergen was interviewed on loving life tv, a south african community channel, and he explained that he took blood samples when his patients started complaining about chronic fatigue, dizziness, memory issues, paralysis and late onset of heavy menstruation from women 60 years old and up. The patients blood showed unusual tube-like structures, some particles that lit up and numerous damaged cells. Van welbergen said had never seen those blood formations before. Last february 12, van welbergen appeared again on the loving life tv channel to show images of his newest slides of blood samples. Blood slides show unvaccinated patients infected with vaccine toxins through shedding van welbergen talked about nearly 100 blood slides from both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. The slides showed that the unvaccinated patients had been infected with vaccine toxins through shedding. (related: fully vaccinated individuals are shedding graphene and infecting the unvaccinated, causing serious health complications. ) he also showed an image of normal healthy red blood cells as seen with a microscope where there is no coagulation or foreign objects in it. The biomedical doctor said that is what normal blood should look like. Van welbergen also showed an image of a person who has been injected with the experimental covid jab. The blood was coagulated and the misshapen red blood cells were clumped together. The image also showed a few healthy red blood cells alongside the graphene fibers. The size difference between the graphene fibers in relation to the red blood cells can be seen. The size of the graphene fibers can block capillaries. The image also showed that the graphene fibers are hollow and contain red blood cells. These strands or tubes appear to be hollow  its really odd. When you really expand it you can see some cells in it, but we dont know if its a crystalline structure or organic. The few healthy cells are circled. The rest are cracked and fractured  theyre finished. Thats not healthy blood. We see it again and again, said van welbergen, who is a highly qualified biomedical specialist in private practice. Van welbergen also began to notice a magnetic or electrical polarity effect on various sides of the graphene fibers. In one of the image, it showed a fiber along with cells that were coagulated. According to van welbergen, this behavior was not seen before but it is now can be seen in almost every sample. He added that this is an indication that these things have changed, their reaction with surrounding blood cells has changed ... And i dont know what triggered it. Another image showed a blood sample from an unvaccinated three-year-old child that showed pieces or shards of graphene that are the result of shedding, which means that the graphene has been transmitted by the vaccinated parents to the unvaccinated child. Another image showed a blood sample from an eight-year-old unvaccinated child whose blood had been contaminated and destroyed by the transmission of graphene from vaccinated people. The childs right arm and upper right leg were basically paralyzed. Van welbergens presentation was truly an eye-opener and frightful at the same time but, it is a must-watch  especially for people who said that the covid injections are safe and are insisting people be injected.

273	0	Cardiologist says 30 percent of vaccinated pilots would fail health screenings due to vaccine injuries 04/24/2022 / by news editors joshua yoder, an airline pilot and co-founder of the u. S. Freedom flyers said during an interview wednesday that a cardiologist told him that if the airlines were conducting certain health screenings, 30 percent of the pilots currently flying would probably be disqualified due to vaccine-induced heart conditions. (article by debra heine republished from amgreatness. Com) yoder told tech millionaire and vaccine safety research foundation founder steve kirsch that his group has received hundreds of reports about pilots flying planes while suffering from adverse side effects from the covid vaccines. The most prominent health issues being reported, the pilot noted, include chest pains, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Yoder said that three vaccinated pilot called him yesterday and said that theyre currently flying with chest pains, and another one said he is being treated by a cardiologist. He noted that the pilots want to remain anonymous because they dont want to lose their jobs. Yoder said the u. S. Freedom flyers would like to find a solution for these pilots, and work with doctors, the federal aviation administration (faa), airlines, and unions to come up with a protocol so they have some kind of immunity that would allow the pilots to talk openly about what is happening to them. The usff formed last fall to help employees in the transportation industry oppose the federal laws surrounding vaccinations. Im afraid if we keep going down this path, at some point its going to end in catastrophe, he said. If passengers actually knew what was going on at the airlines and the faa, they would be livid, and everyone would be jumping on a class action suit against all of them, he said. Yoder said that world renowned cardiologist dr. Peter mccullough told him that if the pilots were regularly tested, a significant number of them would probably have to be grounded. He [mccullough] said that if every vaccinated pilot were to be screened, there would be somewhere around a 30 percent loss in manpower, yoder told kirsch. Mccullough, along with idaho pathologist dr. Ryan cole, robert kennedy jr, lt. Col teresa long m. D. , lt. Col. Peter chambers d. O. And other experts signed letter to the federal aviation administration and the major airlines on dec. 15, 2021, urging them to flag all vaccinated pilots, and administer ekgs, d-dimer tests, troponin tests, and cardiac mris to assess their health. The doctors warned that adverse events from vaccination could cause a pilot (to lose) control of his aircraft and lead to untold devastation. As american greatness reported on wednesday, an american airlines pilot recently suffered a cardiac arrest six minutes after landing his airbus at the dallas-fort worth airport. Captain robert snow nearly died when his heart stopped on april 9, according to yoder. They had to shock him three times with the aed [automated external defibrillator] to bring him back, he said. Yoder noted that snow was taken to baylor, scott and white health center, which is only ten minutes from both american airlines, and the union (the allied pilots association), yet no one from the airline or union called snow while he was in the hospital, or stopped by to visit him. The only thing the airline did was fly his family to the hospital to meet with him. Snow called the u. S. Freedom fliers for help, and the group assembled a world-class team of doctors and lawyers to assist him. Snow is now recuperating at home, yoder said. Yoder acknowledged that it is pretty clear that snows cardiac arrest was caused by the johnson and johnson vaccine, but the pilot has been undergoing a series of tests to confirm it. Yoder told kirsch that the airline industry does not seem to want to deal with the potentially dangerous incident. American airlines is trying to create as much distance between themselves and this incident as humanely possible, he said. So is the faa, and so are the unions. We cant even get a response. Yoder said that snow would be speaking out soon, and when he does youre going to hear some very interesting details that are going to be very damning for american airlines, the allied pilots association, the faa, and everyone else involved. Yoder also mentioned two other pilots who have bravely come forward to talk about their vaccine injuries. Pilot greg pierson has spoken out against the covid vaccines ever since he suffered a stroke after getting the jab under duress, last year. Pierson said during an interview last december that if he had had his stroke while piloting a plane, he could have caused a crash.

Twitter. Com/mficeymou0  information chaser? (@tsubject) december 31, 2021 cody flint was an agricultural pilot up until he was vaccinated in february of 2021. A couple of days after his jab, he suffered a mid-flight blackout, landing safely only by the grace of god, he says. Flint was diagnosed with a neurological disorder that caused him to have severe headaches and vertigo. Since then, his career has collapsed, hes had multiple surgeries and countless doctor visits. And so far, nobody responsible for vaccine development or roll out has been willing to talk to him, or others like him.																
274	0	Pfizer ceo wants americans to be forced to take an annual covid-19 vaccine for greater compliance 04/28/2022 / by jd heyes americans will be required to take an annual covid-19 vaccine if pfizer ceo albert bourla gets his way. In what is obviously a naked attempt to drive up big pharma profits, bourla said last week a vaccine that will be taken once a year is way [easier] to administer and have the population be compliant with it, and we are working on that. The ceo made his recommendation during a press conference that was set up by the international federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers & associations (ifpma) in which he talked about the creation of yet another new covid vaccine. What the world really needs is a vaccine that can last a year, he said, adding that the notion is part of what he termed the optimal public-health solution  which, of course, assumes that covid-19 is going to even be an annual problem (since sars, mers, and other coronaviruses that have appeared in the past were no more than one-time occurrences). Asked by media press briefing host claire doole about whether he believes there will even be a need for an ongoing vaccine regime, bourla responded in the affirmative, saying that covid-19 is very difficult to eradicate. The most likely scenario is that the virus will continue being with us for the years to come, said bourla, who appears to know something about the virus that most of us do not know. After acknowledging that the current protection offered by the existing vaccines is not long-lasting, the ceo complained about the lack of urgency among most people to take a follow-on booster shot, highlighting the shrinking number of people getting them after each booster is introduced (perhaps thats because the virus is fading fast). The issue is that right now we are in many, many countries in the fourth dose, and that creates a fatigue, he said. Way more people got the second [dose] than the third ... [and] i think the compliance with the fourth dose will not be as high as we have had [previously]. Strangely, however, he cited the lack of popularity for boosters as the primary reason why there should be an annual vaccine produced. [we] realized that people will not comply with the fourth or fifth vaccination ... This is why we need to come [up with] scientific innovations that will allow us to have a vaccine that is annual, he said, going on to lament resistance to global covid-19 restrictions and mandates, including vaccine requirements. He then called the refusal to take the largely still experimental mrna injections, which have caused millions of adverse reactions around the world, due to politicization of the shots, which he then said was damaging public health. I think that what didnt help at all, and this was a very big issue, was the fact that there was a politicization, he said. It became a political statement [to get] a vaccine or [to] wear a mask or not, and that created tremendous damage to global health. The big pharma ceo was then asked about producing a vaccine that was more suited for the omicron variant, but went on to talk about the potential of creating one vaccine that will address all known variants. Its easy to do something only against omicron, he said. What scientifically and technically is more challenging, but that we need to do, is to be effective against everything known so far. Asked if he believed that a vaccine could be ready by the fall of 2022, bourla said it is a possibility that we will have it by then but thats not a certainty. He told the press conference that currently, hes waiting for more data before he will make a decision about what type of vaccine to produce. Once we have [more] data about that, it will allow us to make a decision as to which one is the best path forward, because in our studies right now we are testing different vaccines, he said. We dont need another annual vaccine, and certainly not one for a virus that is devolving. Bourla is just looking out for pfizers bottom line and he doesnt care if his product harms anyone.																
275	0	Claim: covid-19 mrna vaccines contain snake venom substrate 04/19/2022 / by kevin hughes the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) mrna vaccines contain a snake venom substrate, according to perfect society channel host olaf kaufman. Kaufman showed articles about the study that found a link between covid-19 deaths and snake venom in august and september 2021. The vaccination started in december 2020. He referred to an article about a university of arizona study that said researchers have identified the key molecular mechanism responsible for covid-19 mortality, which was an enzyme related to neurotoxins found in rattlesnake venom. Kaufman also mentioned the race specificity of the sars-cov-2 virus based on several studies that prove beyond doubt that the bioweapon virus cannot be of natural origin. (related: dr. David martin: covid vaccines are bioweapons designed for genocide. ) the host mentioned distearoylphosphatidylcholine or dspc. It is a phosphatidylcholine, a kind of phospholipid that can be used to prepare lipid nanoparticles. For the uninitiated, lipid nanoparticles are used in mrna vaccines and forms part of the drug delivery system for the moderna and pfizer covid-19 vaccines. He also mentioned glycerophospholipids, which like dspc are substrates for phospholipases a2 (pla2s) that play a pivotal role in proinflammatory mediator or eicosanoids release through the arachidonic acid (aa). The cytosolic pla2s may cause anaphylaxis and lysosomal pla2s complement activation. Pla2s may participate in intracellular signaling that leads to allergen-induced production of inflammatory cytokines, especially in asthmatic patients. The ionizable lipids that are used in both vaccines are novel amino lipids and their allergenic potential is not known. Covid mrna vaccines are causing severe allergic reactions published results on allergic reactions after the first dose of the two mrna vaccines in the u. S. Have estimated rates of 4.7 and 2.5 anaphylaxis cases per million covid-19 vaccine doses administered using pfizers and modernas, respectively. Pla2s enzymes are commonly found in mammalian tissues as well as arachnid, insect and snake venom. In december 2020, 1,893,360 initial doses of pfizers covid-19 vaccine that were given resulted in 175 cases of severe allergic reaction of which 21 were anaphylaxis. It happened at the onset of the vaccine rollout, long before claims about the snake venom enzyme pla2 was present in covid-19 vaccines. Kaufman said people must press charges and an investigation must be initiated about the issue. The podcaster pointed out that all the measures being enforced by the government are genocidal and that the whole pandemic is really about pushing the genocidal agenda of the globalists. He stated that the main goal of the globalists is the genocide of seven billion people and being able to control and enslave the rest of humanity with their synthetic telepathy machine. Kaufman said the global elites want to remotely control peoples electromagnetic brainwaves and take away their free will. He said this is possible with artificial intelligence or ai controlling electromagnetic brainwaves. The podcaster stressed that people must prevent the slow kill inoculation or genocide vaccine, which has no therapeutic value at all. He also emphasized that it is not found among the known definitions of a vaccine because this is the first time the food and drug administration has approved a synthetic mrna vaccine and that it is only for emergency use authorization.

276	0	Covid vaccine complications will soon collapse our health system, warns renowned virologist 04/22/2022 / by ethan huff one of the most talented vaccine creators in the world has warned that the coming onslaught of wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccine injuries and deaths will be so large that a total collapse of the health system is inevitable. Dr. Geert vanden bossche, who used to work as a senior program manager at the global alliance for vaccines and immunization (gavi), warned listeners in a message to austria regarding that countrys lockdown measures that the true fight for health is in not getting vaccinated. Last year, as you may recall, vanden bossche stated publicly that trying to vaccinate people in the midst of a pandemic is about the worst thing you can do if stopping the spread is truly your goal. We need to help them as much as we can because they will need extensive treatment, in many cases, vanden bossche said about the fully vaccinated who have no idea what will soon become of them. The number of fully jabbed requiring hospitalization, he further warned, is now steadily increasing with no end in sight. Whereas more and more, with training of the innate immune system, with more exposure to the virus, more and more non-vaccinated people get protected, he further explained. This will lead inevitably  and i am not a doomsday preacher  but this will inevitably lead to a collapse of our health system. It cannot be otherwise. Covid vaccines actually suppress innate immunity, leaving the body more prone to diseases contrary to what is widely claimed, injecting these poisons into human bodies does not promote strengthened immunity. In fact, the jabs are suppressing innate immunity, which is required for generalized protection against disease. Man-made chemical cocktails, in this case experimental in nature, cannot substitute for innate immunity, vanden bossche stressed, nor do they contribute to so-called herd immunity. With this in mind, it is especially egregious to inject children with the stuff since their innate immunity can easily be suppressed by vaccinal antibodies, vanden bossche warned. [their] antibodies are so young and so naive that they can easily be outcompeted by vaccinal antibodies, he added. This is actually true for all vaccines, which compete against and usually defeat innate immunity, leaving a person prone to autoimmune disorders and other problems throughout his life. The fact that children have a zero percent risk of dying from the fauci flu, or even showing symptoms of infections, makes the jab push on them even more nefarious. How many vaccinated children will now suffer a lifetime of health problems due to getting injected? In vanden bossches view, jabbing children with these biological agents is an absolute no go! We cannot vaccinate our children with these vaccines, he says. Adults are similarly damaged by the shots, which likewise suppress adult immunity. Depending on a persons age and existing health status, getting shot could mean a death sentence, even if it does not happen immediately. And the booster shots? Vanden bossche called the concept absolutely insane during a recent presentation, further calling them dangerous nonsense that should not be done! Those who remain unvaccinated should stay that way no matter what, vanden bossche said. They more than likely already possess immunity to whatever it is that is circulating under the name of covid, and any interference with that via an injection will likely trigger health problems. Very importantly, all are protected, vanden bossche said about the unvaccinated. They all are still protected against severe disease and the majority of them will be protected against very mild or moderate disease. Covid, he added, is not a disease of healthy people. People who are in good health have a healthy innate immune system that can deal with a number of respiratory viruses without any problem, he said.

277	0	Your government quietly confirmed the fully vaccinated are developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome while they had you worried about russia-ukraine & the cost of living 05/24/2022 / by news editors something is very wrong, and it is because of the covid-19 injections. (article republished from expose-news. Com) all around the world, governments are publishing official data that all show the same thing. Those same governments however are not willing to explain why. Instead, they are quietly publishing data in the hope that it will get swept under the carpet whilst they have you distracted by war in ukraine and worrying about the cost of living; a crisis created by government policy. But with the publication of confidential pfizer documents, governments around the world are running out of places to hide, and if these worrying trends continue, they will be forced to admit the covid-19 injections are either causing antibody-dependent enhancement or something much worse. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Whilst rare, it is perfectly possible for a medication or drug to cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and data published by public health scotland, the new zealand ministry of health, the government of canada, the uk health security agency, the office for national statistics, and the u. S. Centers for disease control strongly suggests the covid-19 injections should be added to the list. How else can governments around the world explain the fact the fully vaccinated are more likely to be infected with covid-19, more likely to be hospitalised with covid-19, and more likely to die of covid-19 than the unvaccinated? How else can governments around the world explain the huge rise in all-cause mortality rates among the fully vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated? How else can governments around the world explain the 1,145% to 33,715% increase in aids-related diseases, cancers and infections reported to the u. S. Centers for disease controls vaccine adverse event reporting system in 2021? Scotland public health scotland announced in january that from the 6th feb 22, they would no longer report covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status on a weekly basis. Heres why  the charts above have been created using the figures published by public health scotland in their covid-19 & winter statistical report published 16th feb 22, and they show that covid-19 infection, hospitalisation and death rates per 100,000 individuals were consistently higher among the fully vaccinated population. This is what covid-19 vaccination has done to the people of scotland. New zealand the following chart shows the true number of covid-19 cases by vaccination status between 6th jan and 11th feb, and between 12th feb and 24th feb in new zealand. The data has been extracted from the following official new zealand ministry of health covid-19: case demographics reports  covid-19: case demographics report published 25th feb 2022, covid-19: case demographics report published 12th feb 2022, covid-19: case demographics report published 6th jan 2022. As you can see in both periods the fully vaccinated population accounted for the majority of covid-19 cases, but the difference in the number of cases by vaccination status between 12th feb and 24th feb is shocking. The following chart shows the covid-19 case rate per 100k population by vaccination status between 6th jan and 11th feb, and between 12th feb and 24th feb 22 in new zealand base on the cases above  these case rates, just like the public health scotland case rates, certainly pour water on the bonfire of anyone who says vaccination reduces the chances of being infected with covid-19, dont they? This means the covid-19 injections have a real-world negative effectiveness, and were able to use pfizers vaccine effectiveness formula to calculate it. Unvaccinated case rate  vaccinated case rate / unvaccinated case rate = vaccine effectiveness the following chart shows the real-world two-dose covid-19 vaccine effectiveness between 6th jan and 11th feb, and between 12th feb and 24th feb 22  between 6th jan and 11th feb the real-world covid-19 vaccine effectiveness proved to be minus-94.4%, but by the 24th feb, the real-world vaccine effectiveness fell to minus-281.35%. This means the fully vaccinated were 3.8 times more likely to be infected with covid-19 than the unvaccinated/one dose vaccinated population. This is what double vaccination has done to the people of new zealand. Canada despite the government enforcing draconian restrictions which have in turn coerced millions into getting the covid-19 injections, since the turn of the year the country of canada has experienced its largest wave of covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths to date. Why? Official government of canada data shows that the vaccinated population as a whole has accounted for 4 in every 5 covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths from 21st february 2022, up to 17th april. But it also shows the case/hospitalisation/death-rates per 100,000 population have been highest among the triple vaccinated during the same time frame. So high that the data shows the triple vaccinated are on average 4 times more likely to be infected with covid-19, 2 times more likely to be hospitalised with covid-19, and 3 times more likely to die of covid-19 than the unvaccinated. The following chart shows the vaccinated case-rates per 100,000 by vaccination status across canada between 21st feb and 17th april 2022  the following chart shows the vaccinated hospitalisation-rates per 100,000 by vaccination status across canada between 21st feb and 17th april 2022  the following chart shows the vaccinated death-rates per 100,000 by vaccination status across canada between 21st feb and 17th april 2022  this is what covid-19 vaccination has done to the people of canada. England the uk health security agency is also playing the same game as public health scotland, and since the 1st april 2022 has refused to publish any further data on covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status. Heres why  the above three charts have been created using the figures contained in the week 5, week 9 and week 13 uk health security agency (ukhsa) vaccine surveillance reports. The figures show that the case rates between week 5 and week 13 of 2022 were highest among the triple vaccinated in all age groups in england. Not just by a little bit either, and the gap between the unvaccinated and triple vaccinated has been getting worse by the month. All age groups also suffered a higher covid-19 death rate per 100,000 among the double vaccinated except for 18-29-year olds between week 5 and week 9. But this age group only suffered a higher death rate among the unvaccinated in week 5, with week 9 and week 13 seeing an identical death rate among the unvaccinated and double-vaccinated. The only other age group to break the trend was 30-39-year-olds, who flip-flopped back to a slightly higher death rate among the unvaccinated in week 13. But apart from this, all other age groups had suffered a higher death rate among the double vaccinated since the beginning of the year. These arent the kind of figures we should be seeing if a vaccine is effective. These arent even the kind of figures we should be seeing if a vaccine is ineffective. What were seeing here is a vaccine that is having the opposite of its intended effect. The following two charts shows the real-world covid-19 vaccine effectiveness against death among the double vaccinated population in england by age group and week, based on the death rates provided above  (pfizers vaccine formula: unvaccinated rate per 100k  vaccinated rate per 100k / unvaccinated rate per 100k x 100 = vaccine effectiveness) a vaccine effectiveness against death of minus-111% was recorded among 60-69-year-olds, minus-138% among 70-79-year-olds, and minus-166% among people over the age of 80 in week 9 of 2022. But just look at the figures for the 40-49-year-olds. In week 5 a vaccine effectiveness against death of +16% was recorded. Then in week 9 this fell to minus-32%. But then in week 13 this fell to a shocking minus-121%. These figures show that most double vaccinated individuals are twice as likely to die of covid-19 than unvaccinated individuals. The following chart shows the real-world covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population by age-group and week in england between 3rd january and 27th march 2022, based on the case-rate figures provided previously above  this is nowhere near the claimed 95% effectiveness by pfizer, is it? Vaccine effectiveness was as low as minus-391.43% among 60-69-year-olds in week 13, falling from minus 114.8% in week 5. The most concerning declines here seem to be among the 60-69-year-olds and 70-79-year-olds because it looks like they have fallen off a cliff between week 9 and week 13. Thankfully the fall among 18-29-year-olds seems to have slowed between week 9 and week 13 but still sits at minus-231.22% after being minus-29.8% in week 5. These figures show that 60-69-year-olds are nearly 5 times more likely to be infected with covid-19 than unvaccinated 60-69-year-olds, and show that 40-59 and 70-79-year-olds are over 4 times more likely to be infected with covid-19 than their unvaccinated counterparts. The ukhsa claims that vaccine effectiveness wanes substantially over time and this is why its important to get a booster dose. But this is a lie. Vaccine effectiveness doesnt wane. Immune system performance does. Vaccine effectiveness isnt really a measure of a vaccine, it is a measure of a vaccine recipients immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person. A vaccine effectiveness of -50% would mean that the immune system of the vaccinated is now performing at a worse rate than the natural immune system of the unvaccinated. It would mean the covid-19 vaccines have damaged the immune system, and thats precisely what these figures are showing. The following chart shows the immune system performance of the triple vaccinated population in england by age group in per week compared to the natural immune system of the unvaccinated population based on the case-rate figures provided above  positive immune system performance = unvaccinated case rate  vaccinated case rate / unvaccinated case rate x 100 negative immune system performance = unvaccinated case rate  vaccinated case rate / vaccinated case rate x 100 the lowest immune system performance was among 60-69-year-olds at a shocking minus-80%, but all triple vaccinated people aged 30 to 59 were not far behind, with an immune system performance ranging from minus-75% to minus-76%. Even the 18 to 29-year-olds were within this region at minus-70%, falling from an immune system performance of +11.35% between week 51 and week 2, meaning they suffered the fastest decline in immune system performance. Anyone over the age of 60 who has had three jabs should be extremely concerned based on the figures above because they reveal an extremely rapid decline in immune system performance since the beginning of 2022. But thats not to say anyone under the age of 60 shouldnt be concerned, they are already all suffering from an immune system that has degraded on average between 70 and 76%. This is what covid-19 vaccination has done to the people of england... And scotland, and new zealand, and canada, and most likely the rest of the world. The question is, why? Antibody-dependent enhancement? Intensive research conducted by health experts throughout the years has brought to light increasing concerns about antibody-dependent enhancement (ade), a phenomenon where vaccines make the disease far worse by priming the immune system for a potentially deadly overreaction. Ade can arise in several different ways but the best-known is dubbed the trojan horse pathway. This occurs when non-neutralizing antibodies generated by past infection or vaccination fail to shut down the pathogen upon re-exposure. Instead, they act as a gateway by allowing the virus to gain entry and replicate in cells that are usually off limits (typically immune cells, like macrophages). That, in turn, can lead to wider dissemination of illness, and over-reactive immune responses that cause more severe illness. In previous clinical trials of vaccine candidates to combat sars and mers, the studies each failed during the animal phase due to ade also known as pathogenic priming or a cytokine storm. Phase three clinical trials are designed to uncover frequent or severe side effects before a vaccine is approved for use, including ade. But herein lies the problem, none of the covid-19 vaccines have completed phase three clinical trials. The pfizer phase three trial is not due to complete until february 8th 2024, after previously being estimated to complete in april 2023. However, of the information collated by pfizer so far in the ongoing study they have conducted, it is clear to see that they were fully aware in february 2021 that antibody-dependent enhancement was a possible consequence of their covid-19 injection, and it appears they also knew by april 2021 that the phenomenon was killing people. Vaccine-associated enhanced diseases (vaed) are modified presentations of clinical infections affecting individuals exposed to a wild-type pathogen after having received a prior vaccination for the same pathogen. Enhanced responses are triggered by failed attempts to control the infecting virus, and vaed typically presents with symptoms related to the target organ of the infection pathogen. According to scientists, vaed occurs as two different immunopathologies, antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) and vaccine-associated hypersensitivity (vah). Antibody-dependent enhancement would certainly explain why the vaccinated population are twice as likely to be hospitalised with and die of covid-19 than the unvaccinated population, but were not sure it would explain why the vaccinated are up to five times more likely to be infected with covid-19. Another extremely serious condition that would explain the higher case rate as well as the higher hospitalisation/death rate is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). Acquired immune deficiency syndrome? Its a common misconception that acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) is only caused by the hiv virus. This simply isnt true. Acquired (or secondary) immunodeficiency is one of the major causes of infections in adults. These immunodeficiency disorders affect your immune system partially or as a whole, making your body an easy target for several diseases and infections. (source) when immunodeficiency disorders affect your immune system, your body can no longer fight bacteria and diseases. (source) several factors in the environment can cause secondary immunodeficiency disorders. ? (source) some common ones are: radiation or chemotherapy, which can lead to a secondary immunodeficiency disorder known as neutropenia infections due to human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can result in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids) leukaemia, a cancer that begins in the cells of the bone marrow that can lead to hypogammaglobulinemiaa type of secondary immunodeficiency malnutrition, which affects up to 50% of populations in underdeveloped countries and leaves people vulnerable to respiratory infections and diarrhoea but some of the less common causes include drugs or medications. (source) so its perfectly possible for a medication or drug to cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and data published by public health scotland, the new zealand ministry of health, the government of canada, the uk health security agency, the uks office for national statistics, and the u. S. Centers for disease control strongly suggests the covid-19 injections should be added to the list. Read more at: expose-news. Com																
278	0	No, covid vaccines are not safe and effective  these 10 surveys reveal the truth 05/24/2022 / by ethan huff investigative reporter steve kirsch put together a series of surveys that show beyond a shadow of a doubt that wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccines are anything but safe and effective as the government claims. Polling his readers as part of a biased sampling, kirsch asked various questions about how people who got jabbed fared after the fact. The results are truly mind-blowing, especially if you are someone who believes that the jabs are generally nothing about which to worry. Kirsch admits that his surveys are biased, which is why he is encouraging everyone to replicate them with their own friends, family members, coworkers, schoolmates and others, depending on ones walk in life. Peer review kirschs surveys for yourself, if you want to verify them the questions kirsch asked addressed both adverse events and deaths rates. Here is what he concluded based on preliminary results: 1) covid jabs have already killed at least the same number of americans as the covid virus supposedly has. 2) covid jabs are killing 336 children aged 5-11 for every one that is supposedly saved because of the injections. (related: check out this earlier article from kirsch showing that 28 million children would have to get jabbed in order to supposedly save just 14 of them from testing positive for covid. ) 3) getting jabbed a second time is the most dangerous part of the process, increasing all-cause mortality rates by at least 800 percent within 30 days (the first and third injections increase it 600 percent and 480 percent respectively). 4) the true number of covid-related deaths, jab deaths, and annual deaths from heart attack are relatively comparable with one another since january 2020 to the present. This suggests that only around 700,000 people actually died from covid and a comparable number from the covid vaccines, kirsch writes about this specific data point. This is in line with our vaers (vaccine adverse event reporting system) minimum estimate of excess deaths caused by the vaccine: 12,000 vaers excess deaths in the us * 41 (the minimum under-reporting factor) = 492,000 deaths minimum. 5) if you survive covid vaccination and previously had cancer, you are 80 percent more likely to see your cancer worsen post-injection. For half the people who got the shot, their cancer got dramatically worse after the shot, kirsch writes. Nobodys cancer got better after the shot. That is really stunning. How will the cdc explain that one? 6) since vaers underreports by a massive amount, the true number of covid jab deaths could easily be 100 times more than what is officially logged in the system. What we can say is that it appears that at least 0.7% of all deaths and vaccine-related miscarriages were reported to vaers, kirsch explains. None of the 15 deaths of kids 18 and under were reported to vaers. 7) taking into account survey biases, there is clearly no scenario in which any child (let alone any person, period) should ever take any covid injection. 8) if anyone out there thinks that kirsch is wrong with his assessments, they are encouraged to conduct their own surveys and publish the results for comparative purposes. 9) none of this will ever be published in a medical journal because it runs counter to the official narrative. However, kirsch will be allowing his readers, starting on may 23, 2022, to conduct their own independent peer reviews of the data to look for errors, similar to what a journal would do. 10) i encourage you to replicate the surveys yourself if you dont believe me and publish them, kirsch writes as his 10th note to readers. The 10 surveys themselves are all listed and linked on kirschs substack. Take the time to go through each one and see what you think.

279	0	Scientific data shows that the fully vaccinated have become covid super spreaders 01/11/2022 / by ethan huff the government claims that the unvaccinated are responsible for continuing to spread the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) because they refuse to get shot, but the latest data shows that the opposite is true. In ontario, can. , at least, hospital beds are filling up with people who took the jabs, believing they would provide protection against infection. The reality is that the shots are spreading more infection, as well as the new covid variants. Publicly available data from the ontario government suggests that the vast majority of hospital admissions throughout the region are fully vaccinated. As per the information, there seem to be 1,327 fully vaccinated cases in hospitals as of january 7, contrasting to only 441 unvaccinated cases, ' reported great game india. There were 100 patients inside the hospital for partially vaccinated cases. ' there are 119 unvaccinated cases, 17 partially vaccinated cases, and 106 fully vaccinated cases in ontarios icu ... The great proportion of patients who screened positive for covid in ontario originate from fully vaccinated individuals, according to the data. Throughout the province, there were 9,515 cases of the fauci flu among the fully vaccinated as of january 7. This is compared to just 1,543 cases among the unvaccinated and 375 cases among the partially vaccinated. Getting vaccinated will result in the collapse of our health system, warns expert the situation is much the same in alberta and quebec where the vast majority of hospitalizations are occurring in the fully vaccinated. In albert, there were 258 patients in the hospital for covid despite a complete immunization record, along with 19 cases among those with partial vaccination status. In quebec, there were 1,948 fully vaccinated patients in the hospital and 1,046 hospitalizations among the unvaccinated. Overall, the vast majority of sickness and death is on the fully vaccinated side of the spectrum with very few unvaccinated illnesses and deaths. And truth be told, even these are likely a factor of shedding caused by the fully and partially vaccinated. Despite all this, the canadian government is obsessed with the vaccines and still claims that they provide some kind of protection. At best, the shots supposedly reduce the risk of hospitalization, we are told. But even this is a baseless claim without any scientific backing. According to dr. Robert malone, the inventor of the mrna technology used in the injections, people who take the jabs are the true super spreaders, not the unvaccinated. This fact is not stopping canadian minister of health jean-yves duclos from insisting that everyone get vaccinated regardless of the outcome. In his view, all canadians should be forced to take the jabs even if many of them later end up having to be hospitalized. Duclos announced that fauci flu shots will probably soon be mandatory throughout canada, though not everyone agrees. Premier jason kenney of alberta tweeted that at no point will the jabs be required in his province. Albertas legislature removed the power of mandatory vaccination from the public health act last year and will not revisit that decision, period, kenney wrote emphatically. While we strongly encourage those who are eligible to get vaccinated, it is ultimately a personal choice that individuals must make. In india, there is a similar uptick in cases of the wuhan virus wherever the injections are being widely administered. In chandigarh, for instance, 77 percent of all new cases are occurring in the fully vaccinated. A world-renowned virologist and former senior officer at the bill & melinda gates foundation has repeatedly warned about the risks of getting injected. He says that the vaccinated are becoming a breeding ground for the virus, and that the fallout from this will be the collapse of our health system.

280	0	Many people fully vaccinated for covid are now going blind 04/28/2022 / by ethan huff we have heard all about the many cases of myocarditis and pericarditis post-injection, as well as recipients repeatedly testing positive for the virus even after doing the deed. But there is another concerning side effect occurring in the fully vaccinated for the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) that is rarely mentioned: blindness. The latest data out of the united kingdom suggests that a growing number of fully jabbed people are losing their eyesight. The medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) yellow card system currently shows 163 cases of total blindness among people who got jabbed with the pfizer-biontech needle, along with an additional six cases of central vision loss and four cases of sudden visual loss. Twenty-one people also reportedly now suffer from blindness transient specifically caused by the pfizer injection. This adverse reaction involves visual disturbance or loss of sight in one eye for a few seconds or even minutes at a time. Another 20 people beyond that are reported to have suffered from a reaction called unilateral blindness, which is when a person got blind or blurred vision in just one eye (related: roman abramovich recently suffered temporary blindness while attempting to broker peace talks between russia and ukraine; was he recently vaccinated? ) in total, there have been 8,016 eye disorders reported as adverse reactions to the pfizer jab as of 6th april 2022, reported the daily expose. Is it worth possibly going blind just to feel protected against a cold? The astrazeneca injection, which is one of the covid jabs currently available in the u. K. , is also linked to cases of blindness. As of april 6, the mhra has received 324 reports of blindness, three reports of central vision loss, five reports of sudden visual loss, and 29 reports of blindness transient among 14,895 eye disorders, all specifically linked to the astrazeneca needle. Moderna also jabs people in the uk, though at a much smaller rate than the aforementioned companies. Still, many people who take the moderna needle are now blind as well. The mhra shows that in conjunction with the moderna injection, there have been 34 reports of blindness and 56 reports of visual impairment. In total, there have been 1,519 eye disorders reported as adverse reactions to the moderna jab. In all, when including adverse reactions reported where the brand of vaccine was not specified, there have been 24,516 eye disorders reported as adverse reactions to the covid-19 injections, with 525 of these reactions being complete blindness, the expose reported. Fact-checkers alongside authorities have been on the case to sweep this data under the carpet and have labelled it as unreliable. Their reasoning is that just because someone reports the event after having the vaccine, it doesnt necessarily mean it is due to the vaccine. ' one person who goes by the name of louis documented on twitter the story of his wife, who in the weeks and months following her astrazeneca jab went completely blind in her left eye and between 30-60 percent blind in her right eye. The neurologist who treated the woman warned her not to get the second dose of the shot. As you can see the misery which the fact checkers are disregarding as not necessarily the fault of the vaccine is very real for the people who are reporting them, the expose added. But why are the covid vaccines causing people to go blind? The answer could have to do with the fact that covid vaccines also cause major cardiovascular problems, including stroke. Visual loss often accompanies stroke, so it is all starting to make sense. The latest news about the covid-19 vaccine damage can be found at chemicalviolence. Com.																
281	0	Dr. Bryan ardis: native americans have highest mortality rates in us since start of covid pandemic  brighteon. Tv 04/12/2022 / by kevin hughes the native american population has the highest mortality rates since the start of the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic in the united states. Dr. Bryan ardis shared that piece of information during the april 6 episode of his program the dr. Ardis show on brighteon. Tv. Ardis said he looked at the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) websites data tracker, as well as data available in all 50 states, and the native americans easily emerged with the highest death per capita, per race, per week throughout the pandemic. Every week, just about in every state or at least the majority of the states, the race that represented the highest mortality rates per week for the entire two years so far of this pandemic is the native american race, said ardis. I kept saying you have to understand they are targeting the native americans. They are targeting also blacks and hispanic communities. This is something thats going to come to light. They are targeting specific races, including and targeting numero uno the native americans. Theyre also targeting the indigenous people of alaska that they call eskimos. According to a cdc report issued in december 2020, covid-19 incidence was higher among american indians and alaska natives than among non-hispanic whites. Based on data from 14 participating states, age-adjusted covid-associated mortality among american indians and alaska natives was 1.8 times higher than non-hispanic whites. Within american indians and alaska natives, mortality was higher among men than among women, and the disparity in mortality compared with non-hispanic whites was highest with persons aged 20 to 49. Covid-19 vaccines target specific races the vaccine rollout just made it worse, ardis said. The ceo of ardislabs said covid-19 shots contain substances that target the pancreas in diabetics. Guess what race has the highest percentage of diabetics in america? The native americans. Theres no surprise there, ardis said, as big pharmaceutical companies conduct research studies and test their drugs on animals like rats or rabbits and they can use vaccines to test them on humans. They can drug-induce it with a shot. They can target these individuals  hispanics, blacks, native americans, whites, eskimos  they can target them with specific lots of vaccines and put the same substances in those shots that they use in research studies to create diabetic animals. And then they come out with a weapon with this mrna technology that targets diabetics and makes them go hyperinsulinemic or hypoinsulinemic or hyperglycemic, ardis explained. You can create massive amounts of carnage by destroying pancreatic cells. And they are using components in the shots that they know do that. They know that these specific things they have in these shots target the pancreas of people who are diabetics. They are trying to take them out. And its disgusting because, in america, we have literally almost a third of our countrys populace of 330 million people, we have 70 plus million prediabetics that are already diagnosed prediabetic. They are on their way to becoming diabetic and then we have 35 to 40 million currently diagnosed diabetics. Ardis added that the covid shots are not just taking out the diabetics. He said it also targets people who have inflammatory issues with the heart, as well as the kidneys of individuals who are using any kind of prescription drugs.

282	0	Are vaccines killing people of color at twice the rate of whites? 04/19/2022 / by ethan huff the head of the u. S. Department of health and human services (hhs) under joe biden has claimed that vaccines are killing people with dark skin at a much higher rate than people with light skin. Speaking at a digital white house convening on equity seminar on april 14, xavier becerra casually blurted out that he thinks non-whites are suffering from more deadly vaccine side effects than white people. By the way, we know that vaccines are killing people of color  blacks, latinos, indigenous people  at about two times the rate of white americans, becerra said. He then went on to talk about how the government needs to work much harder to get more people injected, even though the numbers are way up compared to last year. So, on vaccines last year, we saw that about two-thirds of white american adults had received at least one shot of vaccine, becerra continued. That was just barely over 50 percent for black americans and latinos at that particular time. So, again, weve got to work. Today, a year later, over 80 percent of white american adults have received at least one shot. Over 80% of black american adults have received at least one shot. Over 80 percent of latino americans have received at least one vaccine shot. You can watch a clip of the white house convening on equity seminar below: remember when dr. William thompson exposed mmr for causing autism in babies? As you may recall from our earlier coverage, there have been concerns for many years now about how vaccines affect people differently based on their ethnicity. While becerras recent talk referred specifically to wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccines, there are disparities in side effects from other vaccines as well, including the mmr for measles, mumps, and rubella. Based on the data, black babies suffer much worse outcomes, on average, after getting jabbed with mmr  though, just to be clear, all children are harmed by these and other injections. A whistleblower from the u. S. Centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) blew the lid on mmr back in 2015, drawing much ire from the government and the press over this anti-vax claim. Dr. William thompson, who used to work as a top-level scientist at the cdc, revealed that the united states government also covered up data showing that mmr is, in fact, linked to autism. This largely vindicated the science put together by dr. Andrew wakefield, a world-renowned gastroenterologist who observed gut problems forming in children following injection with mmr. The fake news media misconstrued wakefields findings, as you may recall, saying that he falsely linked the shots to autism when all he really did was point out what he was observing in his practice among children who had received the injections. Like mrna (messenger rna) wuhan flu shots, the mmr vaccine comes in a series of two injections, and even a third booster. Mmr has long been on the health communitys radar for causing serious health problems in children, just like covid injections now are. Vaccines are comprehensive fraud, wrote a reader at natural news. Our masters hate blacks, whites, yellow, brown, mixed and little green people, wrote another. The one percent only feel love for their own inbred sociopathic kind. On june 4th, 2015, reuters accurately reported merck drug company criminally colluded with the u. S. Fda to stop all competitors; mmr vaccines from being approved and also merck criminally colluded with the us cdv to hide that the merck mmr vaccine causes autism in infants and children at least 314 percent more since early 2003, said another.

283	0	Covid vaccines can take a year (or more) to kill off their victims 04/28/2022 / by ethan huff proof has emerged showing that death from wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccine is not always an immediate thing. Dr. Avindra nath, a physician from the united kingdoms national health service (nhs) who cares for the vaccine-injured, said he personally knows of a previously healthy 61-year-old man who died about a year after getting injected for the fauci flu. Within days post-injection, the man developed severe neuropathy. And over the course of the following year, his body gradually clotted up before he suffered a massive stroke and perished. The nhs knows about this case but still refuses to acknowledge it or any of the other cases just like it, for that matter. The coroner confirmed the vaccine caused the death, reported steve kirsch. This man was perfectly healthy before the vaccine and his health changed just days later with symptoms consistent with vaccine injured. The blood clots in the autopsy are unique to covid vaccine recipients and not seen in prior years. People everywhere say fully vaccinated friends and family members are suddenly dropping dead chances are that the nhs will never report this death publicly. The government-run health care system will probably also never admit that covid injections cause any health problems at all. To confess this would be to confess that the jabs never should have been released in the first place because they are dangerous and ineffective at preventing disease though it can take a while for the adverse events to appear. The bottom line is this: the death window for the vaccine isnt days or weeks; its at least a year and possibly more, kirsch said. (related: covid vaccines also cause aids) so just because you got your vaccine and are still alive 3 months later, it does not mean that youre out of the woods. Kirsch asked his readers to report any cases they know of in which a person died from the jab(s) more than a year after getting needled. The following are some of their stories. One person wrote that he knows of at least four men, all in their 40s and 50s, who suddenly dropped dead at some point after getting injected. Another wrote that her 41-year-old son was previously in good health but suddenly dropped dead from cardiac arrest after getting jabbed. He had two pfizer shots in the past year, the mother further wrote. The coroner report indicated his heart was seriously enlarged. Another woman named margaret wrote that her fully vaccinated friend, who was 43, died on april 15, 2022. The friend was found dead in her bed, and the autopsy report said it was caused by a heart attack. She had gained weight and had high blood pressure, margaret explained. When do you see 43-year-olds die in their sleep from a heart attack? Someone else wrote that her previously healthy 60-year-old cousin suffered a series of mini-strokes after her fauci flu injections. Several other family members, also jabbed, suffered even worse outcomes. My aunt had her health ruined from stroke and inflammation of arteries, and had to sell her house, this person wrote. My healthy 85-year-old uncle dropped dead, presumably after his booster shot, while visiting his family. My moms partner had cognitive impairment and died in the hospital three weeks after reluctantly getting his second shot. Another relative developed sudden stage 4 pancreatic cancer while my friends fiance suffered seizures that his doctor blamed on anxiety over the wedding. No one connects the dots but it is pretty obvious, this same commenter concluded about all of the incidents. Never had this much illness in family, ever. None of them had covid, but after the injection a few got it. The latest news about chinese virus injections can be found at chemicalviolence. Com.																
284	0	Rheumatologist: significant vaccine injuries now reported in 40% of patients, with a 12-fold mortality increase 05/03/2022 / by lance d johnson robert jackson, a rheumatologist with 35 years of experience, has never seen anything like this in his career. Approximately 40 percent of his fully-vaccinated patients now report significant injuries from the experimental covid vaccines. Many of the injuries involve newly-diagnosed blood clotting disorders. Even though the vaccine adverse events reporting system (vaers) is capturing record levels of vaccine injuries post covid vaccination, the numbers do not reflect the shocking 40 percent adverse event rate being reported by dr. Jackson. This is because vaccine injuries are being normalized. Doctors blindly trust that the vaccines are safe, and they refuse to follow up and report the vaccine injuries that occur in their patients. This is why only one percent of vaccine reactions are reported to vaers in the first place, according to studies. Annual mortality jumps 12-fold after dr. Jacksons patients take covid vaccines dr. Jackson sees about 5,000 patients in a given year. Approximately 3,000 of the patients received at least two doses of a covid-19 mrna injection. Of these fully vaccinated patients, 40 percent reported a significant vaccine injury or adverse event. Roughly 5 percent of the patients are still suffering a year later from a blood clotting disorder caused by the vaccines. Throughout his career, jackson reported around 1 or 2 deaths annually. After his patients got the covid vaccines, there was an unprecedented 12 deaths recorded. The false savior vaccine was neither safe nor effective and is causing a mortality spike that the doctor has never witnessed in his thirty-five-year career! Around 1 in 300 patients were likely killed by the vaccines. The eular database, published in the british medical journal, corroborates these findings. In the study there was over 5,000 fully vaccinated patients with rheumatic or musculoskeletal diseases; approximately 37 percent of these patients suffered from adverse events post vaccination and 4.4 percent of patients experienced a disease flare up after being inoculated. Disingenuously, the study authors concluded that covid-19 vaccine safety profiles are reassuring because a majority of patients tolerated their vaccination well. Covid vaccines may cause further damage to people with over-reactive or compromised immune systems dr. Jackson is subcontracted across the midwest and travels to various hospitals to monitor patients. Because he is not employed by a central medical institution, he cannot be forced to take these vaccines or be censored when he speaks up about the rate of vaccine injury in his patients. Dr. Jackson was able to get a more accurate record of vaccine injuries because he was free to speak about his observations, and he dared to do the follow-up work that many doctors are afraid or too arrogant to do. Dr. Jackson didnt blindly believe that the vaccines were safe, as was reported incessantly by the media and the cdc. He actually asked his patients what happened after they got the shots. Rheumatology patients are often referred to as immune-compromised because they have over-reactive immune systems. Because of their pre-existing condition, these patients are told they are at greatest risk for covid complications and therefore must be vaccinated per the cdc orders. However, according to dr. Jacksons research, the vaccines are more likely to exacerbate their existing autoimmune condition and cause severe adverse events. In an israeli study, patients with an existing autoimmune condition suffered even further after they were given a booster shot. The vaccines can exacerbate a serious condition known as antiphospholipid syndrome. This vaccine-induced syndrome causes blood clotting in patients who already have autoimmune disorders. In the case series, neurological autoimmune diseases following vaccinations against sars-cov-2, researchers found that covid-19 vaccines exacerbate neurological autoimmune conditions. In a scottish study, covid-19 vaccine induced thrombocytopenic, thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events. In a german study, covid-19 vaccines caused cerebral venous thrombosis. The evidence is overwhelming: the covid-19 vaccines are causing greater suffering and death.																
285	0	Previously healthy gorilla dies of multiple organ failure following covid vaccination 05/10/2022 / by ethan huff martha the gorilla, who lived at the gladys porter zoo in brownsville, tex. , recently died after getting vaccinated for the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19). According to reports, martha was perfectly healthy before getting the shot. Afterwards, however, she quickly developed multiple organ failure and died unexpectedly on april 19. A western lowland gorilla who had recently given birth, martha was a very happy and very healthy creature before her immune system was corrupted by the fauci flu shot she was given. The following video shows martha playing with and loving her baby. Last july, gladys porter zoo announced plans to jab all of its animals for covid. Martha was no exception, and now she is no more because of the zoos failure to identify covid shots as a depopulation scam. How dangerous was covid to animals in gladys porter zoo? Asked igor chudov on his substack. Not very dangerous. No animal ever contracted covid, according to the zoo. So now we have a beautiful and thriving gorilla mommy dead for what exact reason? And her cubs are now orphans ... The zoo, of course, is not confessing. But everything is painfully obvious. Young mother also died from multiple organ failure following moderna jab; media says shot didnt cause it humans were never the only target of the globalists when it came to the plandemic extermination agenda. Animals and even plants were also slated for eradication under the plan. Marthas tragic demise will certainly not be the last within the animal kingdom, especially if brainwashed zookeepers continue to embrace covid hysteria while buying into the government narrative pushing the shots. Gladys porter zoo senior veterinarian dr. Tom demaar told the local media that upon necropsy, martha was determined to have suffered multiple organ abnormalities which, in turn, created a life-ending cascade. The cascade began with fibrosing heart disease, which led to renal failure, he added, making no mention whatsoever about the injections that martha had previously received. A similar situation occurred with 39-year-old kassidi kurill, a previously healthy single mom who died of multiple organ failure following injections with the moderna shot. In that case, the jab was mentioned by the media, but specifically in the context of it supposedly not being responsible for kurills death. Of course, the newspaper said, kassidi did not die from the jab, ' chudov writes. Yeah, she died from organ failure. Not the jab. Just as gorilla martha, who also suddenly died from multiple organ failure. Right. It was unrelated, he added. Loving moms martha (a gorilla) and kassidi kurill (a human) did not have to die. Whose lives did they save, exactly? Everyone is having covid so it is not like martha and kassidi stopped anything. Someone who reads chudovs substack wrote that her own dad died the same way as martha and kurill. She waited in the hospital with him for six days hoping for a positive outcome that never came. ... The doctors kept coming in over the days to tell me what else was failing inside of him, this person wrote. It was a rollercoaster nightmare week. Sickens me to death that no one will ever admit it was the vaccine that did it! If they do, theyll likely start talking about risk vs. Reward, like its an acceptable loss. Like they do about martha and kassidi. Im furious. Another wrote sarcastically that zoo animals also need to be protected against other human ailments such as french fries, cars, gun violence and mountain biking accidents. Just inject them with as much stuff as you can and dont ask questions, this person added. The latest news about the death toll from fauci flu shots can be found at genocide. News.																
286	0	Covid-19 vaccines more likely to kill people than save lives, research reveals 05/05/2022 / by belle carter recent data from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) revealed that there have been over one million excess deaths recorded since the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic started two years ago. Excess deaths refer to deaths in excess of historical average. Reported deaths during that time were caused by heart disease, high blood pressure, dementia and many other diseases that are not associated with sars-cov-2. Researchers from the university of warwick said that the scale of excess non-covid deaths is large enough for it to be seen as its own pandemic. Across the globe, the rise of death rates coincide with the vaccine rollout that started in december 2020. Deaths attributed to covid-19 are consistently higher in areas with high vaccination rates. Weve never seen anything like it, robert anderson, cdcs head of mortality statistics, told the washington post in mid-february. The vaccines are not preventing infections, either. Walgreens data shows that during the week of april 19 to 25, only 13 percent of unvaccinated tested positive for covid-19. In comparison, 23.1 percent of those who received two doses and 26.3 percent of those who received a third dose at least five months ago have tested positive for the disease. (related: all of the evidence is in: the covid vaccine is a failure. ) renowned virologist: vaccine is not the solution dr. Geert vanden bossche, former senior program manager at global alliance for vaccines and immunization, warned the public that vaccine is not the solution to the global pandemic. Vanden bossche said the coming onslaught of covid-19 vaccine injuries and deaths could lead to the collapse of the health system. He stated publicly last year that trying to vaccinate people in the midst of a pandemic is the worst thing you can do if stopping the spread of the virus is the main goal. We need to help them as much as we can because they will need extensive treatment, in many cases, vanden bossche said. The number of fully vaccinated ones requiring hospitalization is now steadily increasing, he noted. Whereas more and more, with training of the innate immune system, with more exposure to the virus, more and more non-vaccinated people get protected. Vanden bossche concluded: this will lead inevitably  and i am not a doomsday preacher  but this will inevitably lead to a collapse of our health system. It cannot be otherwise. Natural immunity provides better protection than covid-19 vaccine a study titled rates of covid-19 among unvaccinated adults with prior covid-19, published april 20 on the jama network open, confirmed that natural immunity provides longer-lasting protection against covid-19 than the vaccines. We found that, before the emergence of the [post-vaccine] omicron variant, natural immunity provided a similar degree of protection against covid-19 infection as mrna vaccination, said dr. Ari robicsek, the author of the study and the chief medical analytics officer for providence health and services, a not-for-profit catholic health system. The research analyzed data from over 120,000 patients tested for sars-cov-2 at 1,300 testing sites under the providence health system between october 1, 2020 to november 1, 2021 and was conducted by a team of expert clinicians and scientists from providences research network. The researchers established that their findings are in line with prior studies investigating natural immunity against covid-19 reinfection. Previous studies concluded that the protection associated with natural immunity was between 80.5 percent to 100 percent effective at preventing reinfection. That level of protection is similar to the level of protection supposedly provided by the mrna covid-19 vaccines. However, the researchers noted that the vaccine-associated protection is only against non-severe forms of covid-19. Also, this protection has been shown to diminish six months after the jab.

287	0	Dr. Bryan ardis releases huge allegations: the covid-19 virus, vaccines and some treatments are all derived from snake venom 04/12/2022 / by mike adams dr. Bryan ardis has been making waves this week with allegations that the covid-19 virus, covid vaccines and at least one covid treatment all originated from snake venom molecules (the king cobra, to be specific). The first interview on this was released yesterday by stew peters at red voice media in a documentary-style video called, watch the water. In the video, bryan ardis expresses concern that snake venom-related molecules (peptides or proteins) could have been dripped into the water supply (or released via other methods such as aerosolization) in order to create a covid-19 outbreak fear scenario that ultimately drove people into covid vaccines, lockdowns, mask mandates and other forms of mass medical hysteria. We also interviewed dr. Ardis about this same topic. In a largely unedited interview, dr. Ardis shared with us his extensive research linking snake venom to antibodies, vaccine production, and eerily similar side effects observed from mrna vaccines and covid treatments. As dr. Ardis explains in the video (below), every single side effect attributed to covid-19 is also a known effect from toxic venom exposure. Venomtech just announced a targeted-venom discovery array for new pharmaceutical interventions to anybody who doesnt yet realize that snake venom is routinely used to develop pharmaceuticals and medical interventions, check out todays announcement from a company actually called, venomtech. They are bragging about, targeted-venom discovery arraytm (t-vdatm) libraries provide researchers with a straightforward solution to rapidly screen thousands of individual venom fragments, with each array specifically designed to maximise hits for a specific target. The ceo of venomtech, paul grant, even continued: venomtech has been at the forefront of venom research for drug discovery for more than a decade. Through this relationship with charles river laboratories  a global leader for drug discovery contract research  we can now showcase our innovative technology, introducing the wider industry to the potential of venoms for the successful delivery of more leads, more quickly, for a broad range of targets. Natural news reaches out to gilead sciences to request an interview today, natural news reached out to gilead sciences, requesting an interview with their chief science officer to answer these allegations and present their side of the story on this important issue. So far, no response has been received from gilead. Infowars has also covered this emerging story. A quick internet search reveals plenty of mainstream media publications admitting at the onset of the covid outbreak that it may have been derived from snakes, reports infowars. Com. From scientific american to cnn, the snake theory was promoted widely at first. That story cites scientific american and its 2020 article, snakes could be the original source of the new coronavirus outbreak in china. That story cites the similarity between sars-cov-2 and snake genetic material, stating: snakesthe chinese krait and the chinese cobramay be the original source of the newly discovered coronavirus that has triggered an outbreak of a deadly infectious respiratory illness in china this winter. Dr. Ardis believes that cobra venom was used as the starting point for gain-of-function augmentation of sars-cov-2, effectively transforming the virus into a venom-like payload delivery system that poisons the body much like a snake bite. Also from the scientific american story: the researchers used an analysis of the protein codes favored by the new coronavirus and compared it to the protein codes from coronaviruses found in different animal hosts, like birds, snakes, marmots, hedgehogs, manis, bats and humans. Surprisingly, they found that the protein codes in the 2019-ncov are most similar to those used in snakes. As infowars reports: a 2021 study also connected the chinese krait and king cobra to the covid-19 spike protein, explaining, the discovery of a superantigen-like motif in the s1 spike protein, as well as two other neurotoxin-like motifs that have peptide similarities to neurotoxins from ophiophagus (cobra) and bungarus genera. Later during the interview, dr. Ardis touched on the fact that hydroxychloroquine, defamed by the media, has been known to block nicotine receptors in the brainstem from being injured by cobra and viper venom. That cited study is entitled, toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and faecal samples from covid-19 patients. It concludes: (emphasis added) the presence of toxin-like peptides could potentially be connected to sars-cov-2 infection. Their presence suggests a possible association between covid-19 disease and the release in the body of (oligo-)peptides almost identical to toxic components of venoms from animals. See the dr. Ardis interviews here is dr. Ardis correct about the snake venom origins of covid, covid vaccines and some covid treatments? We present his evidence in the following interviews, which are packed with detailed citations from medical journals and news sources. As stated earlier, we have reached out to gilead sciences to request a response, but so far have received no reply. Here are parts 1 and 2 of the interview, followed by my situation update podcast which further analyzes what may be going on with snake venom and covid-19 (also now called covenom-19):																
288	0	Cdc data: fully vaccinated kids are more likely to get covid-19 than unvaccinated kids 05/20/2022 / by belle carter data from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) showed higher wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) case rates among fully vaccinated children aged five to 11 compared to their unvaccinated counterparts. Cdc reported a weekly case rate of 250.02 per 100,000, compared to 245.82 per 100,000 for unvaccinated children in the said age group on feb. 12. The trend holds for the following weeks up to the third week of march, the latest week with available data. Out of an estimated 28 million children in this age group, about 28.9 percent of children have been fully vaccinated. Pfizers is the only covid-19 vaccine that can be administered to children aged five to 11. The big pharma company hasnt commented yet regarding the report. Cdc is assessing whether to continue using these case rate data to provide preliminary information on vaccine impact, cdc spokesperson jasmine reed told the epoch times via email. On may 13, a study published by the journal of the american medical association found that the protection provided by pfizers covid-19 vaccine wanes considerably over time. Dr. Peter mccullough, a renowned cardiologist and epidemiologist, told the epoch times that most non-randomized studies attempting to estimate vaccine efficacy (ve) has some common flaws, including no accounting for prior covid-19 infection; no reporting for currently boosted within a six-month time window; and no adjudication of hospitalization or death due to covid-19 or other conditions. As a result, most studies of covid-19 ve have biases towards overestimating any clinical benefit of vaccination, mccullough said. (related: uk data shows shockingly high mortality rate among fully vaccinated children. ) cdcs data also shows that the gap in rates of cases between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated has become increasingly smaller among other age groups. The death rates show the same trend between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated for people above 50, as well as for people under 50 years old. Data shows that the covid-19 vaccines have a negligible effect on people, said mccullough. With these results in hand, it is clear the vaccines are having a negligible effect on populations. Given the overall poor safety profile and lack of any assurances on long-term safety, americans should be cautious in considering additional injections of these products. Kids contract other diseases after vaccination children aged five to 11 years became eligible for covid-19 vaccination on nov. 2, 2021. A few months later, reports emerged from all over the world that kids contract other illnesses apart from getting the covid virus. The world health organization (who) disclosed last month that 169 children from different countries aged one month to 16 years had developed acute hepatitis of unknown origin. There were also recent reports about some mysterious cases of hepatitis among children in australia. Eight-year-old ryleigh jones from virginia got vaccinated on jan. 6. Six days later, she felt ill and was diagnosed with covid-19 and functional neurological disorder, a rare disease that is yet to be fully studied by health experts. Her mother told the doctors that the pfizer mrna vaccine might be responsible for her illness, but they didnt take her seriously. The johns hopkins university hospital also refused to listen to the mother and the doctors diagnosed the kid with porphyria and celiac disease. Ryleigh is now struggling to walk and talk. Five-year-old pixie calo-lamadora from the philippines received her first mrna injection on march 22. Less than 13 hours later, she was rushed to the hospital and put on life support. Pixies mother posted an update on april 20 that the child had been released from the hospital after 27 days, 14 of which she spent in intensive care. Pixie can no longer walk as per her mothers social media post. She may be able to walk again, but only after years of physical therapy, the doctors said. Vaccineinjurynews.

289	0	Most covid deaths now occurring in fully vaccinated people 08/26/2021 / by ethan huff the government of the united kingdom has released new data showing that the vast majority of delta variant deaths are occurring among people who got fully vaccinated for the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19). Only one third of all deaths supposedly caused by the delta variant are occurring in people who did not get the jab, which clearly shows that operation warp speed is an utter failure  assuming that saving lives was the goal, anyway. From february 1 through august 2, the u. K. Recorded 742 deaths allegedly caused by the delta variant. Of these, 402 were fully vaccinated while 79 had received just one shot. The remaining 253 cases were unvaccinated. You can view the official government report outlining the data at this link. If you get covid having been vaccinated, according to this data, you are much more likely to die than if you were not vaccinated! Writes chris waldburger on his substack. Obviously some allowance must be made for more elderly people being vaccinated, but not enough to change the bottom line: this vaccine is not nearly as effective as advertised. Covid vaccinations must stop in the best interest of public health in every country where fauci flu shot uptake is high, including in israel, deaths and hospitalizations are soaring. A whopping 60 percent of all new hospitalizations in israel are fully vaccinated patients who are now being told by their government that they need a third booster shot in order to stay safe against vaccine-caused mutations. The powers that be will not admit there is something terribly wrong, waldburger adds, calling for a complete recalibration of global policy as the only moral option here. They will not acknowledge the clear science that people with natural immunity, and the young and healthy, do not need to take the risks of these injections. Waldburger also explains that natural immunity, meaning real immunity, is the best way to go. Vaccine-induced immunity, if you can even call it that, lasts for only a very short time at best. At worst, it destroys natural immunity forever, leaving a person prone to a lifetime of disease. You can learn more about natural immunity and why it is superior to vaccine-induced immunity. How many more new variants will emerge from the booster shots? Now that this is becoming widely apparent with wuhan flu shots, governments around the world are ramping up the booster shot propaganda, claiming that a semi-annual injection is necessary for the fully vaccinated to stay immune to disease. This makes no sense, of course, as the first two jabs clearly did nothing to promote immunity while leaving the injected prone to disease. The apparent hope, however, is that the injected will turn off their brains and just obey the orders. Once the booster shot campaign really gets going and additional needles are plunged into arms, we expect a slew of new variants, likely even more deadly than the last, which will drive calls for a fourth booster, and so on and so forth, forever. The plan would seem to be to so destroy peoples immune systems with these shots that they are forever reliant upon big pharma and the government to give them their next hit of immunity every six months or so. The truth is probably that the 253 unvaccinated deaths were from other causes, not covid or delta, speculated one commenter at chris waldburgers blog. Historians will look back and call this the malignant hypochondria era, wrote another. So there really is something going around thats far more pernicious than covid-19.

290	0	Natural immunity provides better protection against covid-19 than pfizer vaccine, israeli study confirms 09/02/2021 / by arsenio toledo a new israeli study has confirmed that natural immunity from a previous wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) infection can offer more protection than getting two doses of the pfizer-biontech coronavirus vaccine. The study was conducted by a team of israeli researchers from tel aviv university and maccabi healthcare services. It was done long after the post-vaccine delta variant of covid-19 became the dominant coronavirus strain in israel and had begun wreaking havoc in one of the worlds most vaccinated nations. Fully vaccinated people several times more likely to get covid-19 for this study, the researchers looked at more than 800,000 people, some of whom had received both doses of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine and never had coronavirus and others who were unvaccinated people who had recovered from previous covid-19 infections. (related: great news: natural immunity to coronavirus is comprehensive and durable  study. ) the researchers found that fully vaccinated people were several times more likely to experience a breakthrough covid-19 infection than people with natural immunity to the coronavirus. According to the study, fully vaccinated individuals who had no prior exposure to the coronavirus were 5.96 times more likely to get infected with the delta variant compared to those with natural immunity. They were also 7.13 times more likely to experience covid-19 symptoms. These symptoms include coughing, developing a fever and experiencing shortness of breath. After three months, this risk in fully vaccinated individuals increases. They become 13.06 times more likely to get infected, and 27.02 times more likely to experience covid-19 symptoms. This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer-lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the delta variant of sars-cov-2, compared to the [pfizer-biontech] two-dose vaccine-induced immunity, read the study. The study authors stated that their research is the largest real-world observational study that compared the immunity supposedly given by the covid-19 vaccines with natural immunity gained from previous coronavirus infections. Our large cohort, enabled by israels rapid rollout of the mass vaccination campaign, allowed us to investigate the risk for additional infection  either a breakthrough infection in vaccinated individuals or reinfection in previously infected ones  over a longer period than thus far described. The israeli researchers admitted that their study has some limitations. Firstly, they only looked at the lack of effectiveness of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccines. More studies have to be conducted to analyze natural immunity when compared with people who take other covid-19 vaccines. Secondly, while the researchers controlled for factors such as age, sex and region of residence, there may be differences in how often these groups follow pandemic protocols instituted by public health authorities. These include wearing masks and practicing social distancing. Despite these limitations, the study could have serious effects on covid-19 policy if so-called public health experts are willing to listen to the science. Scientists laud israeli study for confirming power of natural immunity multiple noted scientists have already come out to support the findings of the israeli study. Its a textbook example of how natural immunity is really better than vaccination, said dr. Charlotte thalin, a physician and immunology researcher for the karolinska institute and the danderyd hospital in sweden. To my knowledge, its the first time [this] has really been shown in the context of covid-19. The study demonstrates the power of the human immune system, wrote journalist meredith wadman, writing for science magazine. But she also cautioned unvaccinated people against intentionally seeking to get infected and said that people should still get vaccinated. We continue to underestimate the importance of natural infection immunity ... Especially when [infection] is recent, wrote dr. Eric topol, a physician and scientist working for scripps research. Ross clark, a columnist for british magazine spectator, believes that this study proves mandating covid-19 vaccines for children is unnecessary. We might be wasting our time trying to foist jabs on the young when they may have gained better, stronger immunity to covid through natural infection, clark wrote. Perhaps it is better to simply allow them to be infected on the grounds theyre highly unlikely to come to serious harm but are more likely to gain lasting immunity from the disease that way.

291	0	Neurologist explains why vaccinated people are still contracting and spreading covid-19 at a high rate 09/10/2021 / by nolan barton dr. Michael segal, a neurologist and neuroscientist, explained in a recent article published by the wall street journal why people vaccinated against the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) are still contracting and spreading the disease at a high rate. Segal wrote that the vaccines only stimulate internal immunity but do nothing to address mucosal immunity. Internal immunity protects the inside of the body while mucosal immunity provides the first line of defense by protecting the nose and mouth, and by doing so also reduces spread to others. He said that all covid-19 vaccines are largely ineffective at stimulating the secretion of a particular form of antibodies called immunoglobulin a (iga) into our noses that occurs after actual infection with a virus. Meanwhile, those who have contracted and recovered from the disease have both mucosal and internal immunity. They have what they call a natural immunity from the disease. A recent study in israel proved that natural immunity is better than getting vaccinated. The researchers found that vaccinated people were 13 times as likely to become infected and 27 times as likely to have symptomatic infections as people with natural immunity. (related: covid-19 natural immunity vs vaccine-induced immunity guide. ) recovered covid-19 patients retain broad and durable immunity to the disease an emory university study published in the journal cell reports medicine found that most people who have recovered from covid-19 retain a broad and durable immunity to the disease, including some degree of protection against its variants. Rafi ahmed, the lead author of the paper, said that the findings disproved early reports during the pandemic that protective neutralizing antibodies did not last in covid-19 patients. The study serves as a framework to define and predict long-lived immunity to sars-cov-2 after natural infection. We also saw indications in this phase that natural immunity could continue to persist, ahmed said. Sars-cov-2 is the virus that causes covid-19. After people recover from infection with a virus, the immune system retains a memory of it. Immune cells and proteins that circulate in the body can recognize and kill the pathogen if its encountered again, protecting against disease and reducing illness severity. The study involved 254 covid-19 patients between 18 to 82 years old, who provided blood samples at various points for a period of over eight months beginning april last year. About 71 percent of the patients had mild disease, 24 percent experienced moderate illness and five percent had severe disease. Ahmed and his team found that most of the patients who recovered mounted a strong and wide-ranging immune response to the virus for at least the 250-day duration of the study. Long-term immune protection involves several components. Antibodies recognize foreign substances like viruses and neutralize them. Different types of t cells help recognize and kill pathogens. B cells make new antibodies when the body needs them. All of these immune system components have been found in people who recovered from covid-19. But the details of this immune response and how long it lasts after infection have been unclear. Scattered reports of reinfection with sars-cov-2 have raised concerns that the immune response to the virus might not be durable. A study published on jan. 6 in science analyzed immune cells and antibodies from almost 200 people who had been exposed to sars-cov-2 and recovered. Drs. Daniela weiskopf, alessandro sette and shane crotty from the la jolla institute for immunology led the study. It was funded in part by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) and the national cancer institute (nci). Time since infection ranged from six days after symptom onset to eight months later. More than 40 participants had been recovered for more than six months before the study began. About 50 people provided blood samples at more than one time after infection. The researchers found durable immune responses in the majority of people studied. Antibodies against the spike protein of sars-cov-2 were found in 98 percent of participants one month after symptom onset. As seen in previous studies, the number of antibodies ranged widely between individuals. But their levels remained fairly stable over time, declining only modestly at six to eight months after infection. Experts recommend that coronavirus be allowed to circulate throughout population some experts are now recommending that the virus be allowed to circulate throughout the population, with precautions taken for vulnerable individuals. We dont have anything that will stop transmission, so i think we are in a situation where herd immunity is not a possibility and i suspect the virus will throw up a new variant that is even better at infecting vaccinated individuals, andrew pollard, director of the oxford vaccine group, told a parliamentary panel last month. Pollard argued that if mass testing was not stopped, the uk could be in a situation of continually vaccinating the population. He said that only those with symptoms should be tested while others should go about their daily lives. Icelands state epidemiologist voiced similar sentiments. We really cannot do anything else but allow the virus to take its course in order for the population to achieve herd immunity, said porolfur gudnason, chief epidemiologist of icelands directorate of health. (related: study: 2 in 3 indians have natural immunity against coronavirus, meaning herd immunity is already achieved. ) we need to try to vaccinate and better protect those who are vulnerable but let us tolerate the infection. It is not a priority now to vaccinate everyone with the third dose. Mass vaccinations need to stop governments need to stop mass vaccination drives to get a shot at herd immunity. In march, vaccine expert dr. Geert vanden bossche said in an open letter that ongoing mass vaccination drives are likely to further enhance adaptive immune escape as none of the current vaccines will prevent replication or transmission of viral variants. Immune escape is a term used to describe when the host is no longer able to recognize and counter a pathogen such as a relevant variant or mutant of sars-cov-2. The more we use these vaccines for immunizing people in the midst of a pandemic, the more infectious the virus will become, vanden bossche wrote. With increasing infectiousness comes an increased likelihood of viral resistance to the vaccines. Under this scenario, manufacturers will be forced to refine or improve the vaccines, which will then increase the selection pressure. Selection pressure is a term used to describe the process that helps an organism or pathogen to evolve in ways that make it better adapted to its changing environment. An antibiotic resistance, which is caused by overuse of antibiotic drugs, is a good example of selection pressure. The virus will effectively outsmart the highly specific antigen-based vaccines that are being used and tweaked. Vanden bossche said the much more infectious viral variants are already examples of immune escape from our innate immunity. Follow pandemic.

292	0	Vaccine genocide: dr. Peter mccullough says covid vaccines have now killed more americans than world war i 04/12/2022 / by arsenio toledo / comments bypass censorship by sharing this link: new  copy url vaccine genocide: dr. Peter mccullough says covid vaccines have now killed more americans than world war i epidemiologist and cardiologist dr. Peter mccullough warned that more americans were killed by the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccine than some of the wars involving the united states. Mccullough made this claim while speaking at the covid-19 town hall of optimist bahamas on april 8. Optimist, which stands for offering preventing therapeutic interventional medicines increasing safety and trust, is an organization of doctors, other healthcare professionals, lawyers and concerned individuals who do not want countries to rely on the vaccine only strategy for dealing with the covid-19 pandemic. According to its website, optimist does not want to be called anti-vax. The group added that its only goal is to educate the public about alternative preventative measures and treatment strategies for dealing with the coronavirus. This includes the potential use of banned treatments and therapeutics like ivermectin. Strategically targeting each phase of the covid-19 disease (contraction, incubation, acute illness and recovery) is vital, wrote the organization on its website. Covid vaccines have killed thousands of americans as evidence for his claim, mccullough used multiple scientific papers showing americas accurate death count from the experimental and deadly covid-19 vaccines. He argued that the actual death count is likely significantly higher than what is documented in the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers), the federal governments program for collecting reports of injuries and deaths caused by all vaccines. (related: global pandemic of the vaccinated gets worse as more people take deadly shots. ) brighteon. Tv [a paper] concluded that the upper bound of a confidence interval for death could be as high as 187,000 americans losing their life after vaccination. It could be that bad, he said. For comparison, around 116,000 americans died during world war i. The only other american wars that have more fatalities than the covid-19 vaccine are world war ii and the civil war, where around 405,000 and 655,000 americans died, respectively. Citing data from the federal governments vaers program, mccullough explained how many of the severe adverse reactions to the vaccine originated in many parts and organs of the human body where covid-19 vaccine particles were found. I can tell you, looking at this vaers report with 12,000 americans who have died, voluntarily after taking an injection, the covid-19 vaccine is worse than a war, he said. Its worse than most wars. Mccullough added that 86 percent of the time the report is made by a doctor, a nurse or a healthcare professional who thinks the vaccine caused the problem. He is referring to a recent analysis of covid-19 vaccine death reports submitted to vaers. The most recent analysis includes data released on vaers on april 8 and is updated through april 1. According to the data, vaers has received a total of 12,298 reports regarding covid-19 vaccine-related deaths if mcculloughs analysis of the recently published scientific papers is correct, this means vaers has only recognized less than one-fifteenth of the actual number of deaths in the u. S. Due to the covid-19 vaccine. Learn more about the covid-19 vaccine casualties in america by reading the latest articles at vaccinedeaths. Com. Watch dr.

293	0	Covid-19 vaccines as part of a depopulation agenda its ba-ack. Antivaxxers are once again claiming that covid-19 vaccines are part of a depopulation agenda. Same as it ever was. Post author by orac post date june 21, 2021 236 commentson covid-19 vaccines as part of a depopulation agenda global depopulation yep. If you believe antivaxxers, covid-19 vaccines are part of a "global depopulation" agenda, along with gmos, the federal reserve, eugenics, and all the other conspiracies out there. As ive long been saying, when it comes to the covid-19 pandemic, everything old is new again, at least with respect to the antivaccine movement. I listed a number of the tropes repurposed by antivaxxers for covid-19 last week, including (but not limited to) misinformation claiming that covid-19 vaccines are loaded with toxins (the lipid nanoparticles in the mrna-based vaccines, given that they cant contain aluminum, dont you know? ); blaming every death reported to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) database on vaccines, not designed to determine causation and we would expect a large baseline number of deaths in the time periods covered by random chance alone; claiming that vaccines cause alzheimers and prion disease; blaming the vaccines for cancer; resurrecting the favorite old trope of shedding from the vaccinated in the most risible manner possible; invoking evolution to predict the selection of more deadly coronavirus variants that could wipe out humanity; warning that the vaccines can permanently alter your dna; and that they cause female infertility. So what other evil thing could vaccines do? Depopulation, anyone? Last week, i saw another such trope, one ive seen many times before, dating back at least to the h1n1 pandemic in 2009. It comes to us courtesy of uber-quack dr. Joe mercola, was the whole pandemic about the vaccine? It even featured someone weve met before, peter mccullough, whos known for pushing a narrative of a covid-19 vaccine holocaust. The central message, of course, is that the pandemic is all about getting people to accept the vaccine, with mercola asking, could it be that the whole covid-19 pandemic was about the vaccine and getting a global mass vaccination campaign underway for population control purposes? After touting dr. Mccullough as one of the most courageous well credentialed academic physicians out there who, despite his impeccable credentials, he has been vilified for stating during the very beginning of the covid-19 pandemic. As you might recall, the main reason why dr. Mccullough has been vilified is because hes been abusing his credentials to spread covid-19 misinformation and conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories like this: all roads lead to the vaccine, mccullough said in a recent interview (video above1,2), with stakeholders banking on countries mandating the vaccine worldwide. The first video above is a 16-minute outtake from a much longer interview, which is the second video.3 mccullough points out that a number of countries are already talking about making the as-yet unlicensed covid-19 vaccine compulsory, meaning anyone and everyone can be forced to take it against their will. Thats how bad stakeholders want vaccination, mccullough says. They do want a needle in every arm. But why? Thats the million-dollar question right there. Heres the video, if youre interested: dr. Mccullough brings the conspiracy theory home. Does he ever! Does anyone remember welcome back, kotter? (thats how old i am. ) i feel like going all arnold horshack right here: yes, orac felt just like this when asked why they might want a covid-19 vaccine in every arm. Thats because i know the answer to mcculloughs question. Maybejust maybethey want to vaccinate everyone in order to bring about the end of a deadly pandemic thats sickened 176 million and killed nearly 4 million worldwide, with 600,000 deaths in the us alone (which is likely an undercount). Just a random thought. After all, as long as the vaccination rate remains too low, there will be areas where the virus can spread again, causing localized outbreaks, in much the way measles showed up in areas of low mmr uptake pre-pandemic. Of course, to people like mercola and mccullough, its a conspiracy. Because of course it is. Vaccine incentives over the last several weeks, the pace of vaccination in the us has slowed, increasingly governments and private companies have been offering incentives for vaccination. It is, of course, not surprising that the pace of vaccination would start to slow down after a fast start. After all, those who most want to be vaccinated were the ones who sought out the vaccine, even when it was not yet widely available and getting vaccinated still took some effort. Now that the vaccine supply has caught up with (and surpassed) demand, the task has become more difficult, and its not just antivaccine misinformation thats the cause. The people remaining to receive the vaccine include the young (who might not think they need it), those without easy access to the vaccine such as the poor and those who have difficulty taking time off from work to get vaccinated and feel that they cant afford to be sidelined by side effects, and, yes, the vaccine hesitant. As a result, some states and businesses are offering incentives, which mercola, being mercola, sees as a conspiracy: recent weeks have seen a significant rise in all sorts of vaccination incentives in the u. S. , from free doughnuts, cake,4 french fries, hot dogs and pizza,5 to arcade tokens,6 10-cent beer,7 free state park season passes,8 free uber and lyft rides,9 free marijuana10 and cincinnati reds baseball tickets,11 a chance to win a full scholarship12 and even $1 million13 and $5 million14giveaways. Below is a more complete list of incentives, posted on vaccines. Gov.15 as you might expect, the million-dollar lotteries have proven to be a resounding success, credited with enticing millions of people to get their shots.16 as noted by ohios first vax-a-million lottery winner, the chance of a windfall was too great to resist. I kept hemming and hawing about it, and i work all the time, and when the vax-a-million thing started i immediately went down there and got it. It pushed me over the edge, he told a local paper.17 to say the vaccine push has an air of desperation about it would be a profoundly serious understatement. I will admit to some... Uneasiness... About some of the incentive programs, such as the million-plus dollar lottery. That being said, it does appear that the incentives are working to some extent, as recently the vaccination rate has started to recover after cratering a month ago, and it looks as though incentives are here to stay, at least until the vaccination rate hits a high enough point to forestall large outbreaks and renewed surges. Unsurprisingly, mercola repeats the gambit invoking the vaccine adverse events reporting system (vaers) database to claim that covid-19 vaccines are deadly. Ive already written about that particular deceptive ploy, most recently the last time i discussed mccullough, but also as far back as february. I even alluded to it as far back as december. So, uncharacteristically, i wont go into that gambit (much) here, other than to mention that mercola also trots out the lie that the vaccines are experimental gene therapy. So what, according to mercola and mccullough, is the real reason why authorities want high levels of vaccination against covid-19? They want to depopulate the world. No, im not kidding: why is the vaccine pushed in this way? Mccollough believes its a global goal to mark people, to get you into their vaccine database, which will eventually be turned into a tool for population control, courtesy of vaccine passports. When were talking about population control, there are two distinct forms, and both may apply in this case. One form of population control is about controlling people through the ideology of utilitarianism, vaccine passports and a social credit system, all of which are tied together. Another form is actual depopulation. Of course, this, too, is an old antivaccine conspiracy theory repurposed for covid-19 vaccines. Indeed, i was writing about this nine years ago, at least, when antivaccine conspiracy theorist jon rappoport wrote essentially the same thing about the h1n1 vaccine, namely that it was a plot to depopulate the world. Ill be referring back to rappoports article after i look at mercola and mcculloughs claims. The depopulation agendas mercola argues that there is a depopulation agenda being promoted bywho else? The global elites. Mercola first distinguishes between two forms of the depopulation agenda. The first is utilitarian andof course! Includes nazi comparisons: utilitarianism is based on a mathematical equation that some individuals can be sacrificed for the greater good of the majority. In other words, if some people are harmed by vaccines, its an acceptable loss because society as a whole may or will reap gains. This discredited pseudo-ethic has repeatedly been used to justify horrific human rights abuses. The third reich, for example, employed the utilitarian rationale as an excuse to demonize and eliminate minorities judged to be a threat to the health, security and well-being of the state.35now, utilitarianism is being called upon yet again, under the false narrative that mankind as a whole is in peril unless everyone rolls the dice and gets vaccinated. In the end, the idea is that vaccine refusers wont be allowed to freely participate in society any longer. This is the disincentive or negative incentive, which is added on top of the positive incentives previously mentioned. In particular, mercola does not like so-called vaccine passports, which, i admit, is a term that i dont like so much in that it refers not just to vaccination requirements to travel internationally but to all requirements for vaccination, including requirements that one show proof of covid-19 vaccination before one can be hired for certain jobs, go to concerts, fly on an airplane, and more. There are legitimate concerns about vaccine passports, such as how they would impact minorities and the poor more because they have less access to the vaccine and how they would impact poor countries, where the vaccines are barely available yet. Thats not what mercola is about, however: the point is, once youre in this system, youre under someone elses control. If they say you have to get a booster shot, you have to comply  again and again  or risk losing basic human rights, such as the ability to buy and sell, travel or get an education. Notably, mercola doesnt really explain how such vaccine passport systems result in depopulation, other than to engage in conspiracy mongering about how such a system might end up being like that of the chinese governments system, and chinas government is an authoritarian one. Its the logical fallacy of the slippery slope argument, in which he invokes a slippery slope (without using the actual term), in which vaccine passports lead to something like the chinese social credit system, in which people with low social credit scores cant travel on certain kinds of public transportation, cant travel overseas, hold certain jobs, go to school or even get a loan. How one leads to the other in democracies, mercola doesnt explain. Thats the point. Its also why he quickly pivots to an active depopulation agenda: the other form of population control refers to actual depopulation. A primary problem the global elite have been trying to solve for a long time is that there are too many people consuming too much of the worlds perceived limited resources and polluting everything in the process. The answer, in their mind, is to reduce the global population. While birth control and abortions are promoted to help with this, these strategies arent effective, or rapid, enough. They need a less fertile population and they need people to die sooner. While many may not want to believe this could possibly be true, you have to remember that the intention is not to cause suffering per se. Its a form of self-preservation, as their end goal is to concentrate all the worlds wealth into their own hands. Ultimately, thats what the great reset is all about. Mercola has invoked the great reset on several occasions. Ive even mentioned these occasions a few times on this very blog, such as when he falsely claimed that covid-19 is a casedemic created by overly-sensitive pcr tests for the virus producing many false positives, when he featured michael yeadon claiming that covid-19 vaccines sterilize women, and when he falsely claimed that covid-19 vaccines are experimental gene therapy that can permanently alter your dna. Basically, the great reset is a conspiracy theory based on a poor choice of words by the world economic forum for a proposal that explored how countries might recover from the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The conspiracy theory posits, in brief, that covid-19 pandemic is being used as a pretext whose purpose is to usher in a tech-driven dystopia free of democratic controls and create a new social contract that ties you to it through an electronic id linked to your bank account and health records, and a social credit id that will dictate every facet of your life. Regardless of the merits of or problems with the world economics forums proposal itself, great reset is a horrible name for it. Its almost as though the world economic forum wanted to provide the perfect fodder for conspiracy theorists! In any event, ive written about michael yeadon before. He appears to be one of the originators (if not the originator) of the lie that covid-19 vaccines cause miscarriages and female infertility that has since mutated and metastasized in various forms. Apparently, yeadon was at one time a fairly high-ranking manager for pfizer, although ive never been able to get a clear picture of what his actual job at pfizer was. Whatever it was, yeadon has used his previous affiliation with pfizer to produce clickbait headlines like head of pfizer research: covid vaccine is female sterilization. This time around, yeadon is claiming that booster shots for covid-19 will be our death knell: of all the lies weve been told over the past year, the ones that worry and frighten yeadon the most are the lies about virus variants and booster shots. In fact, he believes not buying into these lies may be key to your very survival. When your government scientists tell you that a variant thats 0.3% different from sars-cov-2 could masquerade as a new virus and be a threat to your health, you should know, and im telling you, they are lying, yeadon says. If theyre lying  and they are  why is the pharmaceutical industry making top-up [booster] vaccines? ... Theres absolutely no possible justification for their manufacture. And the worlds medicines regulators have said, because they are quite similar to the original vaccines ... We wont be asking them to do any clinical safety studies ... Theres no possible benign interpretation of this. I believe theyre going to be used to damage your health and possibly kill you. Seriously. I can see no sensible interpretation other than a serious attempt at mass depopulation. This will provide the tools to do it, and plausible deniability. Theyll create another story about some sort of biological threat and youll line up and get your top-up vaccines [booster shots], and a few months or a year or so later, youll die of some peculiar inexplicable syndrome. And they wont be able to associate it with the vaccines ... Given that this virus represents, at worst, a slightly bigger risk to the old and ill than influenza, and a smaller risk [than influenza] to almost everyone else ... We didnt need to do anything. [we didnt need] lockdowns, masks, mass testing, vaccines. I can see no sensible interpretation other than a serious attempt at mass depopulation? Seriously? Im half tempted to post another copy of that horshack clip, because i can see a very sensible reason for boosters. Given how widely the virus has circulated, natural mutation has produced a number of variants of concern that are more transmissible and possibly more deadly. It is known that the antibodies stimulated by current vaccines do not neutralize some of these variants as well as they do the original sars-cov-2, although fortunately they still neutralize them well enough to produce strong immunity. For now. The concern, of course, is that eventually there will arise covid-19 variants that can escape the immunity due to the vaccines, coupled with the concern that vaccine-induced immunity might wane to the point where booster shots will be required. Nothing nefarious there. As for that bit about the variants only being 0.3% different from the original? It makes me want to ask yeadon, seriously? Where did you get your phd? Do you not know that small changes in nucleic acid sequence can be all that is necessary to produce significant alterations in protein function? There is only one response to a statement that ignorant: godzilla facepalm i know, i know. Ive been using this meme a lot lately. Naturally, yeadon also thinks that the suppression of cures (such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin) for covid-19 is based on the desire to push vaccines in order to depopulate the world: like yeadon, mccullough has raised serious questions about the need for a vaccine. Evidence clearly shows there are highly effective treatments,37,38 yet theyve been near-universally suppressed in favor of these experimental shots. Why? If its about protecting public health and saving lives, why would effective treatments be vilified? As noted by mccullough during a roundtable discussion in the first of several u. S. -based tribunals on covid-19,39 something very unusual happened in 2020. For the first time, doctors around the world were actively discouraged and prevented from saving their patients. There was an enormous, complete, pervasive, steadfast suppression of any attempts to help patients with covid-19, he said, adding: we seem to somehow have developed a uniform game plan ... To passively allow as much suffering hospitalization and death as possible, create enormous amounts of fear in our society, and then be prepared for mass vaccination. Unsurprisingly, mercola and yeadon are referencing mcculloughs treatment protocol for covid-19 that involves basically throwing everything but the kitchen sink at patients. His protocol includes one fda-accepted drug, regenerons monoclonal antibody cocktail that was issued an eua, followed by vitamins (of course! ), steroids (another drug that works) andalso of course! Hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, zinc, and azithromycin, none of which have been shown to work, and mccullough claims that he could have saved 50-85% of the lives lost to covid-19. So, to tie it all together, according to mercola, citing cranks, covid-19 vaccination is a depopulation program designed to reduce the world population both through causing the institution of authoritarian control of the population and by the vaccines themselves plus booster shots directly causing female infertility, death, and chronic health problems. Quite the conspiracy! And theyre doing this because they need to reduce fertility and cause people to die sooner, the better to reduce the global population and leave the resources for the global elite. H1n1 vaccines and global depopulation this brings me back to jon rappoport and his article from 2012, germ theory and depopulation. Personally, as a scientist, i could never understand what anyone would get out of depopulating the world, and any sort of infectious agent seems to be a very blunt, unreliable, dangerous, and likely ineffective method to achieve such an end, but lets go back in time and see what rappoport claimed. He believed that the h1n1 pandemic from three years before had been a complete dud. Personally, i was very thankful that the pandemic didnt turn out to be nearly as severe as had been feared, but even at its level of severity it did cause a fair amount of havoc. Be that as it may, rappoport claimed he knew what was really going on: swine flu was a propaganda operation, plain and simple, aimed at scaring populations and driving them to get vaccines. That was the op. And it failed. In fact, the op was exposed (by yours truly and others) as a sham and a con. Millions of people online caught on. It was a devastating defeat for who, the cdc, and the medical cartel. According to rappoport, the h1n1 pandemic was a big cover, but a cover for what? Heres where the germ theory denialism came in. Basically, his thought process (if you can call it thought) went along these lines: germs dont cause disease; so vaccines are unnecessary. But if vaccines are unnecessary, what, then, was their purpose during h1n1? Rappoport was happy to answer: lets go deeper. In general, so-called contagious diseases are caused, not by germs, but by immune systems that are too weak to fight off those germs. When we put the cart and the horse in proper alignment, things become clear. I fully realize this isnt as sexy as talking about bio-engineered gene sequences in viruses, but the cart and horse must be understood. Germs are a cover story. What do they cover up? The fact that immune systems are the more basic target for depopulation and debilitation of populations. The reason im quoting rappoport is simple. I just want to emphasize how mercolas claims that covid-19 vaccination programs are in actuality a mass depopulation program are nothing new, just old wine in the new skin of covid-19. This idea goes way, way back. Indeed, you might be familiar with how antivaxxers invoke bill gates as having said that vaccines were for depopulation, based on his remarks years ago about how vaccines can contribute to healthier societies and healthier societies tend to have slower population growth. Long before covid-19, antivaxxers used that statement as evidence that gates somehow wanted to use vaccines to depopulate the world. Since covid-19 hit, theyve quite predictably tarted up the same conspiracy theory for the pandemic. Theyve even misinterpreted concerns about low vaccine uptake among minorities and the targeting of such populations for more intensive outreach to increase their vaccination rates as evidence that not only is the agenda depopulation, but its eugenicist, the depopulation of those people. In fact, sometimes the antivax claim that vaccines are intended for a global depopulation agenda get incredibly ridiculous, which is why i will conclude with what is the most ludicrous example ive ever found. I first encountered it a year ago. Unsurprisingly, it comes from mike adams and dates back to before the pandemic. It even has aliens (because any conspiracy theory can be made better if you add aliens). In adams vaccine holocaust, vaccines will have long latency, such that the vaccinated will spread a bioengineered virus around to all their family, friends, and coworkers. (sound familiar? Shedding, anyone? ) months later, he envisioned people dropping dead in the streets of the virus like a scene out of the early 1970s post-apocalypse movie the omega man, at which point there will be calls for a second round of vaccinations, which will kill more people after an even shorter period of time, days to weeks. But why? Why would globalists want to kill 90% of the population off? According to adams, it would be to save the world. (sound familiar? ) in the meantime, the global elite will have developed ai and robots to do the work of all those billions of people dying off from their vaccine holocaust due to their vaccine bioweapon. Adams contempt for those who accept the science showing that vaccines are safe and effective came through, too. Multiple times, he stated that the globalists think that anyone whos stupid enough to line up to be injected with unknown substances is too stupid to be a part of the future of humanity. He even called them sheeple at least once! Heres where the aliens come in. Adams claimed that the globalists have actually interacted with extraterrestrials more advanced than our civilization and have come to realize that earth must compete and expand with a cosmic economy. Thus the globalists needed to redirect resources into science, colonization technologies, and defense. Instead of spending to keep useless eaters alive, the globalists believe, according to adams, that these resources need to be redirected to survive contact with advanced extraterrestrial civilizations, compete with extraterrestrials, and ultimately be part of a cosmic ecosystem of intelligent beings. I kid you not. Adams even updated this alien conspiracy theory for covid-19, calling it the oblivion agenda in which sars-cov-2 is that bioweapon, with a callback to the day the earth stood still, in which the aliens are telling the global elites that they have to do something, to prevent the earth from becoming hopelessly contaminated: in the following 4-part lecture, i reveal why earth has cosmic real estate value thats recognized by all intelligent civilizations, and why faster-than-light (ftl) travel technology is ubiquitous across the cosmos. Earths location in the milky way galaxy puts it right in the thick of traffic from other civilizations, who have obviously watched the rise of homo sapiens and have no doubt sounded alarm bells over the nuclear weapons testing that humans have been carrying out since 1945. Setting off nukes on your own planet, by the way, is sort of a cosmic-scale way to announce to the universe, we are here, and we are infinitely stupid. Someone please stop us before we destroy everything within reach. Even aliens, you see, cant change the laws of physics. Radioisotopic half-lives are the same, everywhere in the cosmos, and they cant be altered when anything short of nuclear fusion or fission reactors. Once you contaminate a planet with radiation, that planet is a biohazard for millennia, if not longer, and this holds true no matter what life form you might have in mind for occupying that planet. Of course, the aliens also want to terraform the earth. Wait, what? Terra means earth. The earth is already terraformed! You might well wonder why i concluded with mike adams version of the vaccine depopulation conspiracy theory, having already shown that such conspiracy theories are nothing new for the pandemic. The reason is simple. His version of the vaccine depopulation conspiracy theory might be the most out there, but its only marginally more ridiculous than the version being promoted by joe mercola, michael yeadon, and peter mccullough because mike adams version includes aliens. In reality, it is the antivaxxers whose agenda is far more likely to result in global depopulation. Vaccines are arguably the most effective medical intervention to prevent death and suffering ever devised by the human mind, having prevented billions of cases of disease and death over the history of their existence. Anyone who tries to frighten people out of taking advantage of vaccines, for both themselves and their children, is the true advocate of depopulation.																
294	0	Stew peters brings us another blockbuster interview with karen kingston, a former pfizer employee and current analyst for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. She comes forward with indisputable documentation that must be shared with the entire world, immediately. She says, i read the patent to look for graphene oxide. It is not listed in the patent because it is a trade secret. Remember, bill gates saying that there was a trade secret? However, the chinese patent does list graphene oxide. She says the main reason its not listed in the us patent is because graphene oxide is poisonous and its well-known that its poisonous. The other reason is because its the main ingredient of hydrogel, which is the liquid ai template thats used for some of elon musks research and bill gates, as far as creating an interface between humans and the internet. This first round wont connect you the darpa cloud but the intent is to administer boosters every 6 months to see how much graphene we can build up in the system. She says once they perfect this stage, theres a second plan but she doesnt want to speculate beyond what shes documented so far. Stew asks, why are they using graphene oxide? Its a poisonous, toxic substance? She replies, because its a great conductor of electricity and it can host a magnetic field... It could connect you to the internet. Thats why. When asked who is behind the development of these vaccines, she says, theres a company called shanghai nanotech, and they filed the patent for the use of graphene oxide in the covid-19 excipients, tal zaks, the chief technology officer for moderna and if you go to the world health organization website, there is a page where they talk about how the global world needs to work together on these covid-19 vaccines... Youll see the usual suspects; youll see peter daszak and the names from moderna, several names from the nih and the niaid. There is a large group of billionaires and millionaires many, many times over that have coordinated for the development and execution of these products. When stew asks her why would people like donald trump, ron desantis, sean hannity what kind of a stake in the game could they have in promoting the vaccine, she says theres no way they could have known this stuff. She says that when she read this information, she didnt know a woman could cry as hard as i cried. She says last may, she contacted 30 outlets with all of her information, including americas frontline doctors and afterwards, she was shocked to see them still saying, you shouldnt be taking these vaccines if youre under 30. She called them up and said, what the hell are you doing? These are bioweapons! But they told her they couldnt say that. She says, the cognitive dissonance of the depravity and the evil of these injections is very difficult for anyone to understand. And you have to also understand that, for the whole year and half these were being developed, anyone who came out and said, hey, this virus isnt that bad, they were mocked, they were ridiculed, they were ostracized. Doctors were threatened to have their license taken away, so the truth couldnt get out there. Even the fdas own documents discuss these shots being inappropriate for those under the age of 18 and voice concerns about viral shedding. The manufacturing section of the patent application is redacted! No one in good conscience should have approved this but there is such brainwashing going on, such control of basically what big tech wanted us to know as the truth, which was a bunch of lies, that its very difficult for then when someone says to you, this is whats going on, for them to believe it. I would compare it to, anyone thats been in a marriage, where they had a spouse that was cheating on them. Your friends can tell you theyre cheating, theres tons of evidence but you are not going to believe it. All your trusted advisors are telling you this stuff is safe. Its on the media all the time and then someone tells you, no, its lethal. Its a planned genocide. Its impossible to believe. When stew asks her about the dojs pronouncement this week that covid mandates are legal, she goes on a legal tirade, blasting acting assistant attorney general dawn johnsen, who wrote it, saying, her interpretation is reckless and it has no merit. Its just an opinion and its not enforceable, period. And on top of that, whats happened with these vaccines  these injections  is not only is the campaign and the propaganda a bunch of lies, to terrify people into getting injected, which is a violation of human rights in and of itself, on top of that, she doesnt mention title code 21, which is what this memo falls under, because they violated four other sections of that title code, under drug and vaccine safety. Under section 502, its false and misleading labeling, because this thing is not a vaccine. Theres no benefit to your health when you get injected. The only thing it can do it poison, harm and kill. So, theres false and misleading labeling, it doesnt tell you that it contains graphene oxide, adulterated drugs and devices, it also violates section 501, which, again, adulterated drugs and devices is if it includes a toxin, which is the graphene oxide. It also violates section 312.23, under initial new drug applications, so if you go through an ind, you have to prove safety in animals before you move on to humans. They signed a letter of intent for pregnant rats. If that doesnt make you furious, and were injecting pregnant women? And under the ind, it says if theres shedding, if theres risk to people of childbearing age, then you need to stop the trial. We know there is shedding. We know theres risk to people of childbearing age. And the fda even talks about it in their protein therapy and oncolytic virus treatment, that shedding is a real thing and you need to do animal studies first, then you need to do phase one human studies and if there is shedding, then you need to come up with control measures, so that you sont infect the uninjected, which is whats going on right now. They also violated section 312.42, which is clinical research holds and requests for modification. That says if any of these things i said  and there are at least three dozen, you need to stop the trials. Stew says, it doesnt matter how many people die. They will continue this incessant push, wont they? She replies, until the american people speak up and say, enough is enough! Stop it! They will keep pushing us until they basically wipe out america. And theyre going after the children, which is whats so disheartening. There will be no posterity. There will be no america. If people of childbearing age become infertile  and children are at most risk for having adverse events and death from these injections. Just look at the myocarditis numbers. She estimates 4% of children are having decades taken off their lives or are dying. She said she would finish letters shed drafted to healthcare associations, that viewers of the show can send to their employers or to their schools or healthcare providers, saying that we have a right to informed consent. She says it might not prevent them from firing you but she thinks eventually, justice will prevail.																
295	0	Killer covid vaccines: 4,400% increase in deaths compared to all fda-approved vaccines for previous 30 years by brian shilhavy global research, may 08, 2022 health impact news 6 may 2022 region: usa theme: science and medicine print all global research articles can be read in 51 languages by activating the translate website drop down menu on the top banner of our home page (desktop version).

Feel free to repost and share widely global research articles. *** the u. S. Government vaccine adverse events reporting system (vaers) was updated today, and there have now been 1,255,355 cases of adverse reactions filed following covid-19 vaccines since december of 2020, a 17-month time frame. This includes 27,758 deaths and 51,600 permanent disabilities. (source. ) by way of contrast, for the previous 30 years before the covid vaccines were rushed to market with euas (emergency use authorizations), there were 936,214 cases reported with 12,964 deaths and 23,838 permanent disabilities following all fda-approved vaccines during a 360-month period. (source. ) thats a 4,434.22% increase in deaths following covid-19 vaccines, compared to deaths following all fda-approved vaccines for the previous 30 years. And yet, the cdc continues to refer to covid-19 vaccines as safe and effective. Effective in what? The symptoms associated with covid-19 are easily treatable as many doctors have said since the beginning of the pandemic that they were healing covid-19 patients with older drugs such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. The annual flu virus has all but disappeared since covid-19 arrived, so this will go down as the biggest medical scam in the history of the human race. The cdc and fda acknowledge that there are serious side effects with these vaccines, but they call them rare, a term that is really not defined. Yesterday, however, the fda announced that they were only recommending the janssen covid-19 vaccine now in certain cases, due to the reports of blood clots following the vaccines. For immediate release: may 05, 2022 today, the u. S. Food and drug administration has limited the authorized use of the janssen covid-19 vaccine to individuals 18 years of age and older for whom other authorized or approved covid-19 vaccines are not accessible or clinically appropriate, and to individuals 18 years of age and older who elect to receive the janssen covid-19 vaccine because they would otherwise not receive a covid-19 vaccine. Key points: after conducting an updated analysis, evaluation and investigation of reported cases, the fda has determined that the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts), a syndrome of rare and potentially life-threatening blood clots in combination with low levels of blood platelets with onset of symptoms approximately one to two weeks following administration of the janssen covid-19 vaccine, warrants limiting the authorized use of the vaccine. The fda has determined that the known and potential benefits of the vaccine for the prevention of covid-19 outweigh the known and potential risks for individuals 18 years of age and older for whom other authorized or approved covid-19 vaccines are not accessible or clinically appropriate, and for individuals 18 years of age and older who elect to receive the janssen covid-19 vaccine because they would otherwise not receive a covid-19 vaccine. The fact sheet for healthcare providers administering vaccine now reflects the revision of the authorized use of the janssen covid-19 vaccine and includes a warning statement at the beginning of the fact sheet for prominence which summarizes information on the risk for tts. Additionally, information on the revision to the authorized use of the vaccine and updated information on this risk of blood clots with low levels of blood platelets has been added to the fact sheet for recipients and caregivers. Full press release here. How long before they issue similar statements for the pfizer and moderna vaccines? Probably when a new class of covid vaccines hit the market, so that the cash can keep flowing to the pharmaceutical companies, who are the real entities they are protecting, and not the public. Here are some more deaths of younger people who believed the propaganda about the covid-19 vaccines but would probably regret their decisions, if they were still alive. *** frank harrington jr: 44-year-old father of four diagnosed with aggressive post-injection brain cancer, dies three weeks later by the covid blog pulaski, new york  a 44-year-old father, grandfather, and long-time worker for a heat transfer equipment manufacturer is dead, as post-injection cancer continues claiming lives across the globe. Mr. Frank harrington jr. Practically lived on social media. He posted at least 15 times per day on facebook since april 2021. Thus it is difficult to scan his entire profile, as facebook overloads and freezes. One thing is clear. Mr. Harrington never posted the band-aid im vaccinated photos to his profile. Its also clear that mr. Harrington was a mask zealot, vaxx zealot and very loyal to the overall covid-19 faith. The mask and covid zealotry started very early in the so-called pandemic. Keep in mind that mr. Harrington rarely posted original thoughts. Most of his facebook posts were memes and images. He mocked people who caught the flu at a wisconsin protest against lockdowns in may 2020. A few days later, he mockingly compared the american revolution to wearing masks. By august 31, 2021, mr. Harrington mocked people who died from so-called covid-19. It can be reasonably assumed that he had received his first two injections by this time. Three weeks later, mr. Harrington equated parents who opposed masks for their kids at school, to casey anthony. He then referred to the non-vaccinated as drama queens on october 12, 2021, and compared experimental mrna injections to the measles and tetanus shots from the 1970s. Mr. Harrington also fallaciously equated 1950s polio vaccines to the experimental mrna injections in late december 2021. Liberal vaxx zealotry would not be complete without their misconceptions about donald trump. For whatever reason, these types want to believe so badly that trump is an anti-vaxxer when in fact he is one of the top 20 vaxx zealots in the united states. Sad irony and death mr. Harrington continued his attacks on the non-vaccinated after the new year. He mockingly posted on january 11 that the non-vaccinated would rather drink urine than receive experimental mrna injections. Again, mr. Harrington never posted his band-aid/needle photos. But he made clear on january 20, 2022, ill get vaccinated again in order to see rage against the machine in concert. The sad parts of this story unfolded from this point forward. Mr. Harrington apparently lost 70 pounds from january 2021 to january 2022. He wrote on february 3 that friends and family were teasing him, and asking if he had cancer due to the major weight loss. Almost exactly two months later, on april 2, 2022, mr. Harrington was diagnosed with grade iv glioblastoma multiforme. It is one of the most aggressive brain cancers known to man. It is also the same brain cancer that atlanta news anchor jovita moore developed less than two weeks after her second pfizer mrna injection in april 2021. Ms. Moore died six months later, on october 29, 2021, which is about the longest prognosis patients with this condition can expect. Mr. Harrington had brain surgery on friday, april 8 to remove as much of the malignant tumors as possible. Unfortunately some of the masses were inoperable. Mr. Harrington underwent several rounds of chemotherapy and radiation to treat the inoperable tumor in the following weeks. But the cancer was far too aggressive. Mrs. Dawn draper harrington, franks widow, announced that her husband passed away on monday morning, april 25.																
296	0	The vaccine death report: evidence of millions of deaths and serious adverse events resulting from the experimental covid-19 injections may 19, 2022 by steve beckow print friendly, pdf & email detailed. Long. The vaccine death report: evidence of millions of deaths and serious adverse events resulting from the experimental covid-19 injections by david john sorensen and dr. Vladimir zelenko global research, may 07, 2022 () purpose the purpose of this report is to document how all over the world millions of people have died, and hundreds of millions of serious adverse events have occurred, after injections with the experimental mrna gene therapy. We also reveal the real risk of an unprecedented genocide. Facts we aim to only present scientific facts and stay away from unfounded claims. The data is clear and verifiable. Over one hundred references can be found for all presented information, which is provided as a starting point for further investigation. Complicity the data suggests that we may currently be witnessing the greatest organized mass murder in the history of our world. The severity of this situation compels us to ask this critical question: will we rise to the defense of billions of innocent people? Or will we permit personal profit over justice, and be complicit? Networks of lawyers all over the world are preparing class-action lawsuits to prosecute all who are serving this criminal agenda. To all who have been complicit so far, we say: there is still time to turn and choose the side of truth. Please make the right choice. Worldwide although this report focuses on the situation in the united states, it also applies to the rest of the world, as the same type of experimental injections with similar death rates  and comparable systems of corruption to hide these numbers  are used worldwide. Therefore we encourage everyone around the world to share this report. May it be a wake-up call for all of humanity. At least 5 times more deaths, cdc whistleblower signs sworn affidavit vaers data from the american cdc shows that as of september 17, 2021, already 726,963 people suffered adverse events, including stroke, heart failure, blood clots, brain disorders, convulsions, seizures, inflammations of brain & spinal cord, life-threatening allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases, arthritis, miscarriage, infertility, rapid-onset muscle weakness, deafness, blindness, narcolepsy, and cataplexy. Besides the astronomical number of severe side effects, the cdc reports that 15,386 people died as a result of receiving the experimental injections. However, a cdc healthcare fraud detection expert named jane doe investigated this and came to the shocking discovery that the number of deaths is at least five times higher than what the cdc is admitting. In fact, in her initial communications to professor in medicine dr. Peter mccullough, this whistleblower said that the number of deaths is ten times higher. The cdc health fraud detection expert signed an affidavit, in which she stated her findings. She carefully chose the wordings ... Under-reported by a conservative factor of at least five, but as she revealed initially, the factor could also be ten. Here is an excerpt of the affidavit: 1 i have, over the last 25 years, developed over 100 distinct healthcare fraud detection algorithms. ... When the covid-19 vaccine clearly became associated with patient death and harm, i was inclined to investigate the matter. It is my professional estimate that vaers (the vaccine adverse event reporting system) database, while extremely useful, is under-reported by a conservative factor of at least 5. ... And have assessed that the deaths occurring within 3 days of vaccination are higher than those reported in vaers by a factor of at least 5. According to this cdc health fraud detection expert the number of vaccine deaths in the u. S. Is not 15,386 but somewhere between 80,000 and 160,000. The cdc is also vastly underreporting other adverse events, like severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). The informed consent action network (ican) reported that a study showed how the actual number of anaphylaxis is 50 to 120 times higher than claimed by the cdc.2, 3 on top of that, a private researcher took a close look at the vaers database, and tried looking up specific case-ids. He found countless examples where the original death records were deleted, and in some cases, the numbers have been switched for milder reactions. He says: what the analysis of all the case numbers is telling us right now is that theres approximately 150,000 cases that are missing, that were there, that are no longer there. The question is, are they all deaths? 4 how criminal the cdc is, was also revealed a few years ago, when researchers investigated the link between vaccines and autism. They found that there indeed is a direct connection. So what did the cdc do? All the researchers came together and a large dustbin was placed in the middle of the room. In it they threw all the documents that showed the link between autism and vaccinations. Thus, the evidence was destroyed. Subsequently, a so-called scientific article was published in pediatric, stating that vaccinations do not cause autism. However, a leading scientist within the cdc, william thompson, exposed this crime. He publicly admitted: i was involved in misleading millions of people about the possible negative side effects of vaccines. We lied about the scientific findings. 5 the worst example of criminal methodology used to hide vaccine deaths is the fact that the cdc doesnt consider a person vaccinated until two weeks after their second injection. This means that anyone who dies during the weeks before or the two weeks after the second injection, are considered unvaccinated deaths, and are therefore not counted as vaccine deaths. By doing this, they can ignore the vast majority of deaths following the injection. This is the nr 1 method used in nations worldwide to hide the countless numbers of vaccine deaths. 6,7 300,000 adverse events, moderna hides hundreds of thousands of reports a whistleblower from moderna made a screenshot of an internal company notice labelled confidential  for internal distribution only, showing there were 300,000 adverse events reported in only three months: this enabled the team to effectively manage approximately 300,000 adverse event reports and 30,000 medical information requests in a three month span to support the global launch of their covid-19 vaccine. 8 50,000 medicare vaccinated died, us death rate probably near 250, 000 attorney thomas renz received information from a whistleblower inside the centers for medicare & medicaid service (cms), which reveals how 48,465 people died shortly after receiving their injections. He emphasized that these death numbers are from only 18% of the u. S. Population.9 if we apply this to the entire u. S. Population, that would mean a death rate of  250,000. Other factors also play a role of course, such as the age of the medicare patients, and the younger members of the american people, so we cant simply extrapolate this to the entire u. S. Population. But we do see that something extremely serious is going on. Less than 1% is reported, the actual number is 100x higher all this information already shows us that the number of adverse events and deaths is a multitude of what is being told to the public. The situation is however still far worse than most of us can even imagine. The famous lazarus report from harvard pilgrim health care inc. In 2009 revealed that in general only 1% of adverse events from vaccines is being reported: 10 adverse events from drugs and vaccines are common, but underreported. Although 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the food and drug administration (fda). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. According to this study, numbers of adverse events and deaths should be multiplied with a factor of 100, in order to understand the true prevalence of serous vaccine injuries. Reasons for underreporting, the population is misinformed the reason that less than 1% of adverse events is reported, is first of all because the majority of the population is not aware of the existence of reporting systems for vaccine injuries. Secondly, the pharmaceutical industry has been waging an unrelenting media war over the past decades against all medical experts, who attempted to inform the public about the dangers of vaccines. One deployed strategy is name-calling, and the negative label anti-vaxxer was chosen to shame and blame all scientists, physicians, and nurses who speak out about the devastation caused by vaccinations. Because of this criminal campaign of aggressive suppression of adverse events data, the majority of the population is clueless that vaccines can cause any harm at all. The widespread propaganda by the vaccine companies, who use government agencies as their main carousel, simply told humanity for decades that adverse events are a very rare occurrence. When vaccinated people, therefore, suffer from serious adverse events, it doesnt even occur to them that this could be from previous injections, and naturally dont report it as such. During the current world crisis the attacks on medical experts who are warning about vaccines, have gone to an even higher level. Medical experts are now being completely de-platformed from all social media, their websites are deranked by google, entire youtube channels are deleted, many have lost their jobs, and in some countries, medical experts have been arrested in an attempt to suppress the truth about the experimental covid injections. Several countries are now labeling scientists who speak out against vaccines domestic terrorists. It is clear that all means have to be deployed by the criminal vaccine cartel to suppress what is going on with these injections. As a result, countless medical professionals are afraid to report adverse events, which further contributes to the underreporting of these side effects. Additionally, the amount of scientific information warning for these dangerous biological agents, and the number of medical experts warning humanity, is so overwhelming and almost omnipresent  despite the aggressive attempts to silence them  that it is virtually impossible for any medical professional to not be at least somewhat aware of the risk they are taking, by administering an untested dna altering injection, without even informing their patients of what is being injected into their body. If they then see their patients die or become disabled for life, they are naturally afraid of being held accountable, and therefore have yet another motivation for not reporting the adverse events. Lastly: many medical professionals receive financial incentives to promote the vaccines. In the united kingdom for example nurses get 10 per needle they put into a child. That again is a reason for them to not report adverse events. 250,000 vaccine comments, facebook reveals tsunami of adverse events a local abc news station posted a request on facebook for people to share their stories of unvaccinated loved ones that died. They wanted to make a news story on this. What happened was totally unexpected. In five days time over 250,000 people posted comments, but not about unvaccinated loved ones. All the comments talk about vaccinated loved ones that died shortly after being injected, or that are disabled for life. The 250,000 comments reveal a shocking death wave among the population, and the heart wrenching suffering these injections are causing. The post was already shared 200,000 times, and counting... 11 notice in the last comment how the lady says that everybody in the hospital is afraid to report this as a vaccine reaction, and another person says the doctors cant report it. That is proof of what i explained earlier: most medical professionals are either too terrified to report adverse events, or they are simply corrupt. This causes the true prevalence of vaccine injuries to remain hidden from the world, which is powerful real life evidence fot what the lazarus report revealed: only 1% of vaccine injuries are reported to the authorities. The 250,000+ comments show that once people find a place to report suffering caused by the injections, we see a tsunami... Vaccine deaths summary, it is far worse than we think vaers published 726,963 adverse events, including 15,386 deaths as of september 17, 2021 cdc fraud expert says that number of deaths is at least five times, and possibly ten times higher a whistleblower from the centers for medicare & medicaid service (cms) revealed how almost 50,000 people died from the injections. They represent only 20% of the u. S. Population, meaning that if this data is applied to the entire population 250,000 have died 150,000 reports have been rejected or scrubbed by the vaers system the actual number of anaphylaxis is 50 to 120 times higher than claimed by the cdc everyone who dies before two weeks after the second injection, is not considered a vaccine death, which causes the majority of early vaccine deaths to be ignored moderna received over 300,000 reports of adverse events in only three months-time the lazarus report shows that only 1% of adverse events is being reported by the public the majority of the population is not aware of the existence of systems where they can report vaccine adverse events aggressive censorship and propaganda told the public that adverse events are rare, causing people to not understand how their health problems stem from past injections the shaming and blaming of medical professionals who say anything against the vaccines, cause many in the medical community to avoid reporting adverse events the fear of being held accountable after administering an injection that killed or disabled patients, further prevents medical personnel from reporting it having accepted financial incentives to promote, and administer the covid vaccines, also stops medical personnel from reporting adverse events profit driven vaccine manufacturers have every reason not to report the destruction their untested experimental products are causing 250,000+ facebook users comment about vaccine deaths and serious injuries world experts warn humanity, leading scientists issue grave warnings this alarming data leads world experts, like the nobel prize winner in medicine, dr. Luc montagnier, to issue a grave warning that we are currently facing the greatest risk of worldwide genocide, in the history of humanity.12 even the inventor of the mrna technology, dr. Robert malone, warns against these injections that are using his technology.13,14 the situation is so severe that former pfizer vice president and chief scientist dr. Mike yeadon came forward to warn humanity for these extremely dangerous injections. One of his best known videos is titled a final warning.15 another world renown scientist, geert vanden bossche, former head of vaccine development office in germany, and chief scientific officer at univac, also risks his name and career, by bravely speaking out against administration of the covid shots. The vaccine developer warns that the injections can compromise the immunity of the vaccinated, making them vulnerable for every new variant.16, 17 world war ii holocaust survivors wrote to the european medicines agency demanding the injections to be stopped, which they consider to be a new holocaust. 18 vaccine deaths worldwide, the same goes for nations around the world the situation we described in the united states illustrates the destruction caused by these injections. We will briefly touch upon some other countries, to prove that the situation in america is not unique. European union in the european union (which consists of only 27 of the 50 european countries) the official reports of eudravigilance officially admit as of august 18th 2021 that approx. 22,000 people died and 2 million suffered side effects, of which 50% are serious. 19, 20 what are serious injuries? It be classified as serious if it corresponds to a medical occurrence that results in death, is life- threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation, results in another medically important condition, or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. In the netherlands, one of the smallest nations in the european union, an extra parliamentary research committee set up a platform for citizens to report vaccine adverse events. This is no initiative from the government and has received no attention in the media. The majority of the dutch population is therefore unaware of its existence. Yet, despite its limited influence, this private initiative has already received reports of 1,600 deaths and 1,200 health damages, often permanently disabling the people.21 united kingdom shortly before the national vaccination campaign started, the mhra (medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency) published the following request: the mhra urgently seeks an artificial intelligence (ai) software tool to process the expected high volume of covid-19 vaccine adverse drug reaction (adrs) and ensure that no details from the adrs reaction text are missed. 22 the british government published a report of the first series of adverse events, including blindness, strokes, miscarriages, heart failure, paralysis, autoimmune disease, and more. Shortly after the first wave of immunization over 100,000 adverse events were reported, including 1260 cases of loss of eyesight (including total blindness). The first part of the report praises the vaccines to be the best way to protect people from covid-19, and then continues to show the incredible destruction these vaccines are causing. The hypocrisy is mindboggling.23, 24 also in the u. K. Miscarriages increased by 366% in only six weeks, for vaccinated mothers.25 furthermore the british office for national statistics inadvertently revealed that 30,305 people have died within 21 days of having the injection, during the first 6 months of 2021.26 and a british scientist with 35 years of experience did an in depth analysis of the british yellow card reporting system and found it to be unreliable.27 we can conclude that the yellow card reporting scheme can provide some limited information that may be useful for alerting the uk public to possible adverse effects of the covid-19 vaccines. However, the initial conception of the scheme as a purely descriptive rather than as an experimental undertaking means that it cannot address the real issues that are of crucial importance to the uk public. These issues are whether there are causal relationships between vaccination with the pf and az vaccines and serious adverse effects such as death, and if so, what are the size of these effects. Israel the israeli peoples committee is a team of doctors, attorneys, criminologists, epidemiologists and academic researchers, determined to perform an investigation, inquiry, and exposure for the benefit of the public. Although they are a relatively unknown group, they still received 3754 reports, including 480+ deaths, as of august 5th, 2021.28 the ipc states that these numbers represent only 2- 3% of the true prevalence in the population, which means that the number of deaths in israel is around 48,000 and adverse events around 375,400. Also in israel, statistics from worldometers. Info shows a massive spike in deaths when the vaccinations started. Before the immunizations began, there were hardly any daily covid deaths in israel. Once the vaccinations began, the daily death toll rose from 1-3 to 75-100 deaths a day! Another israeli website reporting vaccine injuries is seethetruth. Club/covid-19-vaccine-victims where one can see a rapidly growing number of testimonials of people who suffered greatly from the shot. In the u. S. A similar website called 1000covidstories. Com shows an ever increasing amount of videos from people who died or had severe reactions to the covid shots. Also the website called thecovidworld. Com shows the personal stories of a large number of people who died from the shots. We must understand that nothing like this has ever happened before in history, where thousands of people come forward to share their suffering following an immunization. The reason people do this now, is because their adverse reactions are not at all, like the criminal health agencies say headaches, dizziness and flu like symptoms. The reactions are extremely severe, often disabling people for life. The injuries are in fact so severe, that people around the world are stepping forward to warn humanity. Brazil in brazil the official vaccine death count is 32,000 during a 5 month period. The report was published on uol. Com. Br, which reportedly has about the same number of pageviews as cnn. Com, according to data from similarweb. Despite these high amounts of deaths following vaccination, the report states: vaccination is still the best way to control the disease. 29 science proves vaccine damage, strokes, heart attacks, cancer,... A study by the university of san francisco, or salk institute, shows that the vaccines turn the human body into a spike protein factory, making trillions of spikes that cause blood clots, which cause strokes and heart attacks. 30 another study confirms how the vaccines can cause deadly blood clots, that in turn cause heart attacks and strokes.31,32 the new england journal of medicine shows how the jabs cause heart inflammation,33 and the same journal published a study about the dramatic increase of miscarriages.34 several studies prove the reality of antibody dependent enhancement. 35,36,37 also the occurrence of infertility and reduced sperm count is confirmed.38,39 lastly a study showed that the injections cause cancer.40 and these are just a few examples... Exempt from liability, no vaccine manufacturer takes responsibility in the past decades, several official government agreements were signed, in nations across the world, that provide every vaccine manufacturer with 100% protection from all liability. It doesnt matter how much destruction their products cause, nobody has any recourse. On top of that, no health insurance will ever cover the costs resulting from vaccine damage. They simply do not reimburse the vaccinated, when they get into trouble. Yet... The same governments that refuse to protect you from possible destruction of your health, life, and beloved ones, mandate these deadly injections and require them for shopping, travel, gatherings, and even banking services. Do the injections even work? Health officials say they are not effective world-renowned vaccine developer geert vanden bossche mvd, phd warns that these injections destroy the bodys immune system, making the vaccinated vulnerable for every new variant of the disease.41 he also says: mass vaccination campaigns during a pandemic of highly infectious variants fail to control viral transmission. Instead of contributing to building herd immunity, they dramatically delay natural establishment of herd immunity. This is why the ongoing universal vaccination campaigns are absolutely detrimental to public and global health. 42 the nobel prize winner in medicine dr. Luc montagnier sounds the alarm that these vaccines are creating dangerous new variants.43 and in israel the statistics show clearly a dramatic increase in covid deaths once immunizations started (see earlier in this report). The israeli prime minister naftali bennet even says that the people who are most at risk now, are those who received two doses of the vaccine.. 44 in the island nation seychelles there were hardly any covid deaths, but once they started vaccinating the population, the deaths increased a hundred fold. In australia, a young couple was refused access to their newborn baby for eight days, even though they were fully vaccinated. The chief health officer from australia, dr. Jeannette young, gave the following revealing explanation for this inhumane situation: 45 just because you are vaccinated, doesnt mean that you wont get infected. Thats why we could not allow that family to go and visit their baby. Anthony fauci also made it crystal clear: the cdc is considering mask mandates for the vaccinated,46 the vaccinated increasingly test positive for covid, therefore they will need to keep wearing masks,47 the vaccinated still need to avoid eating in restaurants,48 and the vaccinated carry the delta variant as much as the unvaccinated.49 so according to fauci the vaccines do nothing. Yet he insists on mandating these useless injections for travel.50 the same was publicly stated by the uks prime minister boris johnson, who said: 51 can i now meet my friends and family members indoors if they are vaccinated? There i am afraid the answer is no, because were not yet at that stage, were still very much in the world where you can meet friends and family outdoors, under the rule of six, or two households. And even if your friends and family members may be vaccinated, the vaccines are not giving 100% protection and thats why we need to be cautious. A research article published in trends in internal medicine by dr. J. Bar classen md, is titled: 52 us covid-19 vaccines proven to cause more harm than good based on pivotal clinical trial data analyzed using the proper scientific endpoint, all cause severe morbidity even the cdc admitted that the injections offer no protection against the delta variants, and coming variants, and all covid measures, therefore, need to stay in place.53 yet they keep insisting that everybody must be vaccinated. The chief health officer of new south wales, australia said we have to prepare to live with a constant cycle of ongoing covid booster injections for the foreseeable future.54 modernas chief medical officer, dr. Tal zaks, said that the vaccines do not bring life back to normal.55 this was confirmed by the director of the world health organization tedros adhanom, who said: 56 a vaccine on its own will not end the pandemic. Surveillance will need to continue, people will still need to be tested, isolated and cared for. Contacts will still need to be traced and quarantined, communities will still need to be engaged. A study by the lancet showed that the delta variant is freely transmitted among the vaccinated.57 this was confirmed by a study that showed how a in july 2021, following multiple large public events in a barnstable county, massachusetts, town, 469 covid-19 cases were identified among massachusetts residents who had travelled to the town during july 317; 346 (74%) occurred in fully vaccinated persons.58																
297	0	Foi reveals pfizer and medicine regulators hid the dangers of covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy because study found it increases risk of birth defects & infertility by the expose on may 5, 2022  ( 29 comments ) print friendly, pdf & email a freedom of information request alongside an in-depth dive into the only pregnancy/fertility study performed on the pfizer covid-19 injection has revealed that medicine regulators and pfizer chose to publicly cover-up alarming abnormalities of the developing foetus and falsely downgraded the actual risk of covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy by suppressing documented findings of the clinical data. These decisions led to medical professionals, who are far too trusting of medicine regulators, to wrongly inform pregnant women that the covid-19 injections are perfectly safe during pregnancy, leading to many pregnant women feeling pressured to get vaccinated. This fraud and deception has caused at least 4,113 foetal deaths due to covid-19 vaccination in the usa alone, and a further study shows covid-19 vaccination actually increases the risk of suffering a miscarriage by at least 1,517%. The expose reports the facts the mainstream refuse to. Lets not lose touch, subscribe today to receive the latest news from the expose in your inbox... Email address email address subscribe follow the expose on telegram join the exposes telegram discussion group according to the centers for disease controls (cdc)) vaccine adverse event database (vaers), as of 22nd april 2022, a total of 4,113 foetal deaths have been reported as adverse reactions to the covid-19 injections, 3,209 of which were reported against the pfizer injection. Credit: health impact news the cdc has admitted that just 1 to 10% of adverse reactions are actually reported to vaers therefore the true figure could be many times worse. But to put these numbers into perspective, there were only 2,239 reported foetal deaths to vaers in the 30 years prior to the emergency use authorisation of the covid-19 injections in december of 2020. (source) and a further study which can be viewed here, found that the risk of suffering a miscarriage following covid-19 vaccination is 1,517% higher than the risk of suffering a miscarriage following flu vaccination. Source the true risk could however actually be much higher because pregnant women are a target group for flu vaccination, whereas they are only a small demographic in terms of covid-19 vaccination so far. But all of this pain and misery could have been easily avoided. Because it turns out both pfizer and the medicine regulators who granted emergency authorisation for the covid-19 injections, knew that suitable animal studies hadnt been performed to determine the safety of the pfizer vaccine during pregnancy but then falsely downgraded the risk. They also knew the limited animal study that had been performed displayed a risk of significant harm to the developing foetus, but they actively chose to remove this information from public documents. The information has come to light thanks to a freedom of information (foi) request made to the australian government department of health therapeutic goods administration (tga). A document titled delegates overview and request for acvs advice that was created on 11th january 2021 was published under the foi request. Page 30 onwards of the document shows a review of the product information, and highlights changes that should be made to the non-clinical evaluation report prior to official publication. The changes were requested to be made by pfizer prior to the next product information update, and heres what some of those requested changes were as follows  source the module 4 evaluator requested pfizer remove their claim that animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Why? Source the module 4 evaluator told pfizer that pregnancy category b2 was considered appropriate and requested that they added the following line  a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study in rats showed increased occurrence of supernumerary lumbar ribs in fetuses from comirnaty- treated female rats. But heres how the official document issued to the general public reads  source  page 7 the pregnancy category was changed to b1, no line was included on the increased occurrence of supernumerary lumbar ribs in fetuses, and they instead included the line that was requested to be removed claiming animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy.... Your most likely wondering what supernumerary lumbar ribs in fetuses actually are? And we will get to that, but first lets concentrate on the pregnancy category. Pregnancy category b2, which was considered appropriate b the module 4 evaluator is given when  studies in animals are inadequate or may be lacking, but available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage. Whereas pregnancy category b1, which was assigned in the publicly available official document, is given when  studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage. Source thats quite a big difference between the two categories. But the fact that the module 4 evaluator even thought pregnancy category b2 was appropriate is highly questionable when you consider the results of the inadequate and extremely small animal study that was performed to evaluate the safety of administering the pfizer covid-19 injection during pregnancy. The actual study can be viewed in full here and is titled lack of effects on female fertility and prenatal and postnatal offspring development in rats with bnt162b2, a mrna-based covid-19 vaccine. The study was performed on 42 female wistar han rats. Twenty-one were given the pfizer covid-19 injection, and 21 were not. The module 4 evaluator originally requested pfizer include the line  a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study in rats showed increased occurrence of supernumerary lumbar ribs in fetuses from comirnaty- treated female rats. Here are the results of the study that the evaluator was referring to  source the results of the number of foetuses observed to have supernumerary lumbar ribs in the control group were 3/3 (2.1). But the results of the number of foetuses to have supernumerary lumbar ribs in the vaccinated group were 6/12 (8.3). Therefore on average, the rate of occurrence was 295% higher in the vaccinated group. Supernumerary ribs also called accessory ribs are an uncommon variant of extra ribs arising most commonly from the cervical or lumbar vertebrae. So what this study found is evidence of abnormal foetal formation and birth defects caused by the pfizer covid-19 injection. So why did pfizer and the australian medicine regulator not include this in the publically available official document after the module 4 assessor had asked them to? But the abnormal findings of the study dont end there. The pre-implantation loss rate in the vaccinated group of rats was double that of the control group, and not only was this information ignored, but no request was made to evaluate it further. Source pre-implantation loss refers to fertilised ova that fail to implant. Therefore, this study suggests that the pfizer covid-19 injection reduces the chances of a woman being able to get pregnant. So, therefore, increases the risk of infertility. Despite scientific evidence proving otherwise, medicine regulators and pfizer falsely claimed animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy. Sixty years ago, women were exposed to a new product for morning sickness called thalidomide and it led to at least 10,000 birth malformations. The above findings show that medicine regulators have learned nothing from this tragedy and took an unprecedented risk in their evaluation of the pfizer covid-19 injection. That unprecedented risk led to an outrageous campaign of propaganda and lies targeting pregnant women, and pressuring them to take an experimental and unproven treatment. Despite the fact, authorities demand you avoid smoked fish, soft cheese, wet paint, coffee, herbal tea, vitamin supplements, processed junk foods... (the list is endless) when pregnant. And that outrageous campaign of propaganda and lies has led to thousands of foetal deaths.																
298	0	Fully vaccinated young adults are 92% more likely to die than unvaccinated young adults according to office for national statistics by the expose on may 14, 2022  ( 49 comments ) print friendly, pdf & email official figures published by the uks office for national statistics show that deaths per 100,000 among double vaccinated 18-39-year-olds were on average 91% higher than deaths per 100,000 among unvaccinated 18-39-year-olds between january 2021 and january 2022. This means it can no longer be denied that the covid-19 vaccines are deadly because even the official government published figures now prove it. The expose reports the facts the mainstream refuse to. Lets not lose touch, subscribe today to receive the latest news from the expose in your inbox... Email address email address subscribe follow the expose on telegram join the exposes telegram discussion group the office for national statistics is the uks largest independent producer of official statistics and the recognised national statistical institute of the uk. It is responsible for collecting and publishing statistics related to the economy, population and society at national, regional and local levels. Its latest dataset on deaths in england by vaccination status can be found here. It contains a large amount of data on age-standardised mortality rates for deaths by vaccination status between 1 january 2021 and 31 january 2022. Table 2 of the dataset contains data on the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status by age group for all deaths in england. The following table shows an example of how the numbers are presented in the dataset  what immediately catches the eye when looking at this data is the mortality rate per 100,00 person-years among 18-39-year-olds in the month of january 2021. The figures show the death rate among the unvaccinated in this month was 67.7 deaths per 100,000 person-years. Whilst the death rate among the partly vaccinated (at least 21 days ago) was 119.9 deaths per 100,000 years. This shows that vaccinated 18-39-year-olds were more likely to die in january 2021, suggesting the covid-19 injections increased the risk of death or played a part in causing death. So we dug further and extracted all the figures on 18-39-year-olds for each month between january 2021 and january 2022, and this is what we found  the above chart shows the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status for all-cause deaths, per 100,000 person-years among adults aged 18 to 39 in england. The green line is the mortality rate among the unvaccinated, which while fluctuating has remained pretty stable throughout. The other lines however represent different vaccination statuses, and they are extremely concerning. The orange, yellow, and pink lines represent mortality rates within 21 days of receiving a first, second or third dose. And they reveal that the risk of death increases significantly immediately after vaccination. This may explain why figures found in table 4 of the same ons dataset reveal 41,449 people died within 21 days of vaccination in england between 1st jan 21 and 31st jan 22  but the most concerning figures are the mortality rates among those vaccinated at least 21 days ago, which you can see more clearly in the following chart  around june 2021, there is a cross over from those whove received one dose to those whove received two doses in terms of the increased mortality rate against the unvaccinated. This obviously tallies with when each injection was administered to this age group. But whats most concerning here is that the second injection seems to make things much worse in terms of the risk of death. In january 2021 the mortality rate per 100,000 person-years among the unvaccinated equated to 67.7. This then fell month on month to 33.1 in may, before increasing again in june to 44.8. The same however cannot be said for those who had received a single dose at least 21 days prior to their death. In january 2021 the mortality rate per 100,000 person-years among the partly vaccinated equated to 119.9. Meaning the mortality rate was 77% higher than the mortality rate among the unvaccinated. This then fell to 68.3 deaths per 100,000 in february, before climbing to 90.1 in march, then 108.8 in april. This means at this point the mortality rate among the partly vaccinated was 193.3% higher than the mortality rate among the unvaccinated. But not long after following the second dose being administered things get even worse. The highest mortality rate among the double vaccinated (at least 21 days ago) occurred in september 2021, with 125.9 deaths per 100,000 person-years. In the same month, the mortality rate among the unvaccinated equated to 46.8. Meaning the double vaccinated mortality rate was 169% higher than the unvaccinated mortality rate. But the largest statistical difference occurred in november 2021. The mortality rate among the unvaccinated equated to 33.4 deaths per 100,000 person-years, whereas the mortality rate among the double vaccinated equated to 107. A difference of 220.4%. The following chart shows the average-age standardised mortality rate to have occurred between 1st jan 21 and 31st jan 22 by vaccination status for all-cause deaths, per 100,000 person-years among adults aged 18 to 39 in england  the average mortality rate throughout these 13 months among the unvaccinated equates to 43.9 deaths per 100,000 person-years. But ignoring the mortality rate within the first 21 days of vaccination, we find that this is actually the lowest mortality rate among all vaccination statuses, and these include covid-19 deaths in the rates. The average partly vaccinated (at least 21 days ago) mortality rate equates to 66.3 deaths per 100,000. Whilst the average double vaccinated (at least 21 days ago) mortality rate equates to 84.02 deaths per 100,000 person-years between 1st jan 21 and 31st jan 22. The average triple vaccinated mortality rate is also higher than the unvaccinated rate at 55 deaths per 100,000. But its worth noting here that there is only a couple of months data available on the third jab, so we need to wait for the next update to paint a clearer picture of whats going on with that third dose, but the picture is already not looking very pretty. So what these official figures from the uks office for national statistics strongly suggest is that covid-19 vaccination kills and increases a persons risk of death due to any cause, possibly by the havoc it reaps on both the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. And it appears each additional dose makes things worse. On average the one-dose vaccinated were 51% more likely to die than the unvaccinated between 1st jan 21 and 31st jan 22. On average the double vaccinated were 91.4% more likely to die than the unvaccinated between 1st jan 21 and 31st jan 22. And based on the small amount of data available so far, on average the triple vaccinated are on average 25.3% more likely to die than the unvaccinated, but well have to wait for the next ons dateset to see if the pattern of that mortality-rate increasing holds true. But either way, it can no longer be denied that the covid-19 vaccines are deadly because even the official government published figures now prove it.																
299	0	Study of 23 million people shows risk of myocarditis after covid vaccines on mondays episode of the jimmy dore show, comedian and commentator jimmy dore said a study showing an increased risk of heart problems in young men following covid-19 vaccines highlights how a safety risk once labeled misinformation becomes news that can no longer be dismissed. By susan c. Olmstead 37  link copied miss a day, miss a lot. Subscribe to the defender's top news of the day. It's free. A new study involving 23 million people proves a covid-19 vaccine side effect  once labeled misinformation  is real. So claimed comedian, writer and political commentator jimmy dore on the monday episode of the jimmy dore show. Dore examined an april 21 article in the u. K. S express, vaccine study of 23 million shows risk of heart problems from moderna or pfizer jab. The article reported on an investigation published online in jama cardiology on april 20: sars-cov-2 vaccination and myocarditis in a nordic cohort study of 23 million residents. The jama study vindicates commentators who discussed connections between heart problems and the covid-19 vaccines months or even years ago  and who were dismissed or vilified, said dore. Podcaster joe rogan, for instance, was harshly criticized and accused of spreading misinformation when he first discussed the vaccine-myocarditis connection. But according to the study, both first and second doses of mrna vaccines were associated with increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis. For individuals receiving 2 doses of the same vaccine, risk of myocarditis was highest among young males (aged 16-24 years) after the second dose. 1 million copies sold  the real anthony fauci  the book that launched a movement. Buy today! Specifically, among young men receiving two doses of the same vaccine, between four and seven excess myocarditis and pericarditis events occurred in 28 days per 100,000 vaccinees after the second dose of the pfizer vaccine, and between nine and 28 excess myocarditis and pericarditis events occurred per 100,000 vaccinees after the second dose of the moderna vaccine. The study concluded, the risk of myocarditis in this large cohort study was highest in young men after the second sars-cov-2 vaccine dose and recommended, this risk should be balanced against the benefits of protecting against severe covid-19 disease. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle that can lead to cardiac arrhythmia and death. Pericarditis is inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart that can cause sharp chest pain and other symptoms. The defender has featured stories of people developing myocarditis and pericarditis after covid-19 vaccinations. Dore pointed out that denmark in october 2021 suspended administration of the moderna vaccine to people younger than 18, while sweden did the same for people under 30. Dore also recalled the days when kamala harris and joe biden expressed hesitancy about vaccination when then-president donald trump endorsed it. When people form an opinion about the vaccines based on the political climate, not on data, it shows they are either wedded to their fear or disingenuous, he said.																
300	0	Over two years have gone by since the covid-19 staged psyop was thrust onto the worlds population, fooling the masses into believing that a phony virus (and all its hokey counterparts) existed and that a new type of vaccine was the only answer in saving humanity. At that time, in november, 2020, right before the covid-19 vaccines were dispensed onto the public, i spoke out and forewarned that the mrna technology within the vaccines made them bioweapons, and that millions would be harmed and die if they took the injections. Time has proven me right. By september of 2021, my warnings were substantiated. Vaers data from cdc, which reports american vaccine injuries, provided a clear clue that the vaccines were weapons of mass destruction742,349 vaccine takers suffered adverse reactions (including death) comprising of heart failure, blood clots, strokes, brain illnesses, inflamed spinal cords, seizures, allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases, arthritis, miscarriage, infertility, deafness, blindness, muscle weakness and loss, and sleep disorders. By april, 2022, vaers showed a combined total of 1,247,131 injuries and deaths. And because only 1% of injuries from covid vaccines are reported, it is reasonable to expect that actual deaths and injuries can be up to five times higher. No other type of vaccine over the last 30 years has ever caused this much impairment in such a short time. And though over 1000 scientific studies prove that the mrna covid-19 vaccines are extremely dangerous (including pfizers own data), and uks government data reveals the covid vaccines kill more people than they save, public health departments, hospitals, healthcare organizations and most doctors continue to endanger public health and dispense the lethal jabs. These co-conspirators of mass murder have become like ventriloquist dummies, only speaking when their masters pull open their mouthsallowing the crimes against humanity to mount. As of today, 11.74 billion doses of covid-19 vaccines have been administered worldwide, with most countries showing between a 60% and 86% vaccination rate. And yet current data is suddenly showing that covid cases are spiraling upward into never-neverland, in almost every state, with a whopping 53% increase, which is much higher than a year ago. Wtf is going on? Why are covid tests still spitting out excessive positive readings and why is this virus (which cdc still documents as being a mild virus with symptoms matching the flu) still around after two years? Is sars-cov-2 an illusionary property, an alien pathogen from star wars? Come on, people, use common sense. Science is still science, viruses still work the same, and the art of herd immunity does not magically disappear. This uptick in covid cases is an impossibility because if sars-cov-2 was actually a real live virus and a real outbreak had occurred (as we were told), herd immunity would have kicked in a year ago, with or without the useless vaccines, and curtailed this virus and its variants, and there would be no more pandemic. This alone proves that sars-cov-2 never existed and that the entire pandemic was all about restructuring world governments and exerting absolute control over peoples lives in every aspect possible. Same viruses do not keep infecting people over and over again. Only a virus with a different strain can bring back another illness. In the entire history of medicine there has never been a case where a virus defies the force of nature and overrides the bodys natural ability to prevent invading pathogens. And this is the reason why the bogus covid tests are distributed to the masses. The hoaxers need to keep the minds fearful, the covid lie going, and not allow anyone a chance to question why herd immunity failed to work. The natural cycle of herd immunity has always been and always will be the best vaccine and pill to stop spread of contagions and end pandemics. When enough people become exposed to a contagious disease their bodies automatically build a strong resistance to it, which eventually halts that bug from spreading or doing any more damage. This is why outbreaks eventually fizzle-out. Since the beginning of human life, herd immunity has been a natural life-saver. Without that integral part of the human machinery, civilizations would be unable to fight infection and stop spread, creating a self-elimination process of the human species, and eventually extinction. Even if a virus is created in a bio-lab, the strain would need to be re-released onto the population under a new genetic modification in order to keep reinfecting the population. Our bodys natural immune system always builds antibodies to stop reinfection of the same pathogen, unlessthe immune system is undermined through nefarious means, like the current weaponized vaccines. This explains why the communists in power are using the mrna vaccines against the western populace, and why china and the communist-loving leaders of russia have both refused to use mrna vaccines on their own populations. The mrna vaccines are bioweapons with many purposes, but the main purpose of these toxic injections is to completely destroy adaptive immunity in adults (lifetime immunity that occurs after exposure to pathogens) and destabilize innate immunity in children (natural immunity humans are born with). By doing this the populations of the world will be unable to fight off real viruses and bacteria and the action of herd immunity will be broken, opening the door for shedding diseases and creating super pandemics, which ultimately produces a systematical die-off within a population. The continued reports of vaccine injuries confirm that the mrna injections are creating an immunological catastrophe throughout the western world. This is why those monsters of the deep state are ramping things up and focusing on injecting the children with these bio-vaccines. Fda just approved pfizers covid vaccinations for small children 5 years and up and moderna is now asking for approval to inoculate babies 6 months and older. Trust me, infants will soon be mrna-inoculated. They do not need abortion clinics anymore. They have a better weapon. And this is why articles are popping up in the news justifying eugenics. One article today stated that researchers from columbia university showed that parents who raised more than two kids would come down with weakened brains and lose cognitive sharpness in their later years. This nonsense would be almost laughable if it were not meant as a psychological means to condition the masses to accept the murder of millions of fetuses, infants, and children of all ages. The fact that there is a staged baby formula shortage here in america, and baby-hater bill gates (who was previously caught hiding infertility drugs in his vaccines) and his thugs suddenly came up with a plan to manufacture and sell their own toxic save the environment baby formula (here is gary barnetts exceptional article exposing this) shows just how much these dark people despise children. Bill gates, who is part of gavi, the vaccine alliance that is promoting covid-19 vaccinations, has touted online that gavi is all about saving lives, but that is a monstrous lie because he is a known depopulation-promoter. At one of his speeches for the world economic forum, he spouted the silly notion that people generated pollution, which caused climate change, and therefore human population needed to be curbed. So, tell me, if this man believes humanity needs to be snuffed out like a campfire, why would he invest billions of dollars into healthcare businesses that are supposed to save lives, or invest in baby formula to feed hungry babies whom he believes will grow up to be polluters of the earth? He is a madman who believes a large part of the human race needs to be eliminated, and therefore his investments have nothing to do with saving lives, but everything to do with overseeing the kill switch. Bill gates and company have a lot of bioweaponry ideas up their sleeves for final solutions with which to depopulate the west. The uss dod-darpa and the bill and melinda gates foundation (same partners funding the mrna covid-19 vaccines which are mass murdering millions) are now targeting us citizens as test rats for entomological warfare research and releasing genetically modified mosquitoes into certain states under the guise of limiting the spread of dengue and malaria. This trickery has nothing to do with protecting the public from illnesses because gates and company lets us know all the time that they want to end our lives. Entomological warfare is one of the first generations of bioweaponry that is still the cheapest and easiest way to infect populations. Though it was once considered an outdated mode of transmission, it has now been revived. The epa has approved the release of more than two billion genetically altered male mosquitoes in florida and california following the test release of 150,000 lab-transformed mosquitoes in the florida keys, back in 2021. Anything involving gene-editing is bioweaponry and illegal according to the convention law and should be banned from use. But the infiltrated globalists in our government and healthcare organizations are beyond corrupt, and only care about the completion of their cult-like one world order and ridding the world of the unfit humans in society who they believe are genetically inferior. (they embrace the theory of social darwinism which teaches that the wealthy and those in power are born with superior genes and that the rest of humanity are useless to society). If vaccines can be used as bioweapons, you can be sure the bites of insects can be effective means with which to also transmit lab-created diseases or deliver manmade genetic materials into the nucleus of human cells. The global elite, like mad necromancers clasping pentagrams and chanting incantations over the human race, are setting up citizens for other catastrophic outcomes through mass bio-vaccinations. The secret genetic goodies that they can transport into the nucleus of human cells via inoculation can cause contamination of the original human genome, elimination of certain races and age groups, sterilization of both males and females, eradication of gender, disruptions of the sex drive, forced abortions and miscarriages, restructuring of thought processes, mutation creations, induced lab-created diseases, developed irreparable chronic damages to organs and tissues, and timetabled kill switches. The adenoviral-platformed covid-19 vaccines that china and russia have used to vaccinate their citizenry (chinas vaccine is called ad5-ncov and russias is named sputnik v) also carry bioweapon capabilities like the mrna covid-19 vaccines manufactured by pfizer and moderna. Unlike mrna vaccines, which transports genetic material (fragments of the mrna supposedly carrying a part of the genetic sequence of sars-cov-2) into cells using lipid nanoparticles to encapsulate the mrna material they are transporting, adenoviral vaccines are vector-based and use an inactive or dead adenovirus (such as bronchitis or pneumonia) as their platform to transport genetically coded instructions of the supposed sars-cov-2 into the human cell. The adenoviral vaccines could be a more potent bioweapon because they are able to smuggle in larger genomic material into the nucleus of the cell than through mrna technology, such as genetically-prepared properties of live pathogens, which could create all sorts of mild or deadly outbreaks without the publics knowledge. Viruses and bacterium that could be transported through vector-based platforms could include, to name just a few, hemorrhagic fevers such as marburg or ebola, dengue fever, pneumonic plague, or q fever. I highly doubt hemorrhagic fevers would be used as a choice of bioweapon, but a mild virus would allow the goons in power to keep the pandemic agenda going until everyone is vaccinated and the new world order is fully implemented. But so far, using a fake coronavirus has been enough to keep the pandemic narrative alive, justify weaponized vaccines, and prepare the masses for body bags. Though the united states mainly dispenses the mrna covid vaccines through pfizer and moderna, johnson & johnson manufactures the adenoviral vaccine, and therefore it is no surprise that their vaccines are linked with numerous blood-clotting disorders. The uk uses the adenoviral platform made by oxford-astrazeneca, but europe as a whole distributes more of pfizers mrna vaccines, making sure the western peoples are getting pinched with enough of the mrna shots. And since china has had weaponized bio-vaccines stored in their military stockpiles for the last ten years, and can temporarily disable an enemy, kill specific races through genetic conversions, and be used as time bombs for swift elimination, i find it quite worrisome and suspicious that all of the covid-19 vaccine manufacturers worldwide stepped away from traditional vaccines and developed vaccines that have the potential to do the very same dirty deeds as chinas militarized bio-based vaccines. This is what bioweapons do, and explains why the military and government overseeing these pharmaceutical companies refuse to pull the covid vaccines off the market for further study, even after millions of crippling injuries and deaths have been reported. And while citizens are impaired and dying from the bio-vaccinations, profits and praise could not be better for the vaccine makers. Pfizer made $37 billion alone in 2021 on their covid vaccines. Combined, both pfizer and modernas mrna vaccine profits are expected to hit about $93 billion this year. People kill for a lot, lot less. And albert bourla, pfizers ceo, was even awarded a 2022 prize by the genesis foundation for saving lives. I wonder when bill gates will get his award? The entire staged pandemic was about ushering in a dictatorial new world order and eliminating those who might stand in their way, but most refused to see the coup, allowing infiltrated enemies to imprison the world, destroy freedom, and dispense dangerous bio-vaccines within record time onto the populations. Once america went under full lockdown mode, and normal pandemic response procedures were violated, this was the time when healthcare professionals and the public could have spoken up and stopped the invasion. The signs of a takeover were blatant, like a pretty woman suddenly performing a strip-dance on a busy street corner. There was no logical reason for a mild coronavirus outbreak to warrant lockdowns for a whole population of healthy people. Sick patients should be the only ones under isolation if they have contracted a more serious, highly-contagious pathogen, such as smallpox or one of the hemorrhagic fevers. Even with 60,000 people dying a year from seasonal influenza or the 53% mortality rate of the past bird flu (h5n1) outbreaks (compared to the sars-cov-2 mortality rate of 0.1%), mandatory separation from society was never even considered as part of those preparedness responses. And yet, when it came to another mild coronavirus, the public health departments threw out medical know-how and embraced cruel response measures. And along with the abuse by healthcare professionals who should have known better, most americans passively allowed themselves to be caged in their homes like prisoners and become sitting ducks for foreign invasion. Any political group who locks down an entire population is committing an act of war against their citizens. Even the term lockdowns was a carefully crafted word by the globalists, replacing the normal medical phrase quarantine measures in order to define their victory in conquering the west. Such aggressive actions are always indication that a country or countries are under enemy attack, and yet, two years later, with total proof and evidence in plain sight that a pandemic never existed and that leaders of 193 countries have sold their souls to the devil and are crossing a bridge toward a one world government, the worlds populace simply cares less. The enemies who are taking out western values and laws are patient with the timetable on which their weaponized mrna vaccines will work. They have been planning this global takeover for over 50 years, centuries in fact, and are willing to squat a few more years on their snobbish bogs until the final virus seals the coffin on all of those who are not part of their elitist my-genes-are-better-than-your-genes sadistic mentality. These people are not good people. The government they have planned for the world will not be anything like previous communistic-led governments. Their goals are elimination of all peoples whom they view as genetically unfit for society, complete enslavement for those they do allow to live, and the induction of a new breed of genetically-engineered humanoids who are designed to completely replace the human race. The post-covid-19 life for those who are considered part of the elite group of the wealthy and powerful will live like kings, but the rest of humanity will not be so lucky. The new world for the surviving humans and created humanoids include living in surveilled smart cities, with no privacy, sharing apartments with strangers, owning absolutely nothing, buying and selling based on a merit system, being forbidden to procreate, restricted travel, planned eugenics for certain ages and races, gmo foods, rationed energy and water, no cars, and no rights to make decisions. There will be no malls or retail shopping. Everything will be done online, including healthcare. It will be a life of isolation. This is why the global order is informing us through books, interviews and conferences that humanity will not exist in the future, and only engineered transhuman obedient machines will be walking the earth. Human beings will not be able to mentally adapt to such a regressive lifestyle unless they are genetically-engineered to do so. Because the world will be living under an occult-based existence, with everything in complete contrast to the natural and normal order of life humans have lived under since the beginning of time, there will be no moral or objective laws to protect citizens and families. The worship of god will be prohibited, and without that spiritual barricade that once held darkness at bay and allowed freedom to reign, all sorts of deviance will abound. For over twenty years i have trained first responders, healthcare professionals, and military personnel on counterterrorism, biological warfare and pandemic preparedness. The cold hard fact is that bioweapons will always be bioweapons, developed solely to be used as weapons against civilians or soldiers during warfareto murder and incapacitate as necessary to achieve a successful takeover of nation or nations. Bioweapons have nothing to do with public health safety, and never will. The covid-19 vaccines are weapons, plain and simple. The great reset of nations is set to be in place by the year 2030, and western ideals and values travel in stark contrast to that global agenda. So, tell me, if you had the mindset of the dastardly, how would you quietly silence millions of free thinkers, pilfer their governments, and at the same time preserve whole city infrastructures without messy nukes and bloody drawn-out physical invasions? The covid vaccinations were the weapons with which to jumpstart this hell-on-earth agenda. Though the majority of vaccine deaths and injuries go unreported, time will eventually reveal to what extent those vaccines have been weaponized and what specific groups were highlighted targetsbut hundreds of millions will be gone by then, and the survivors will be living under a diabolical orwellian new world order.																
301	0	5g will trigger sleeper cells in the covid vaccinated to release deadly viruses, such as marburg, in the vaccine to kill the vaccinated dylan eleven dylan eleven may 22, 2022 4 min 5g will trigger sleeper cells in the covid vaccinated to release deadly viruses, such as marburg, in the vaccine to kill the vaccinated paulcraigroberts. Org 5g will trigger sleeper cells in the covid vaccinated to release deadly viruses, such as marburg, in the vaccine to kill the vaccinated "monkeypox" may only be a big distraction from what's really coming, once 5g is ready to be used (against the "vaccinated") dr. Rashid buttar gives us a fair warning that it would be grievous folly not to send to everyone we know in this video, after an 8-minute trailer for plandemic 3, dr. Buttar launches into a harrowing prediction, based on tips from trusted insiders, of whats to come. Since hes been right so far (early on, he took a world of heat for doubting that the virus had passed naturally from bats to humans), we should listen carefully to what hes saying now: that the vaccines contain sleeper cells, set to be awakened (sometime this year, he estimates) by three 60-second 5g signals, which will activate the marburg virus, and other pathogens that will kill vaccinated people by the millions, whereupon the who and cdc will move to save the rest of us by taking over totally and (they intend) forever.  What to do? Having long shouted himself hoarse to warn as many people as might hear him not to get injected, as the toll of vaccination keeps on spiking dr. Buttar is by now too bitter to waste any further tears on those who got the jab, and is focusing instead on the unvaccinated, and the urgent need for them to keep their immune systems strong, since they are at far less risk than those who have rolled up their sleeves as ordered. (it isnt clear if he thinks those whove had just one shot, and/or no boosters, are as doomed as those whose vaccine cards are full. ) somewhat confusingly, he also implies that there are, or may be, effective treatments for the vaccinated, tooas we all hope there are, and as were morally obliged to tell as many people as we can, however we may feel about their vaccination status. Specifically, dr. Buttar stresses the by-now safety and effectiveness of ivermectin, hinting that we all should have that a good supply of that old wonder drug at hand. Having watched dr. Buttars grim presentation, you might then want to read this latest piece in offguardian, as well as dr. Robert malones new riff, about the looming monkeypox, and the high likelihood that this new scare is only thata second blast of fear pornography from our free press, in furtherance of the globalist campaign to keep us in blind panic, eyes wide shut, on our knees.  Original article:  yes, it sounds like science fiction dystopia and hopefully is. But it is in line with bill gates prediction and with whos move to use the next health crisis to seize control:  next week, may 22-28, the world health assembly, governing body of the world health organization (who), will meet to vote on amendments to the international health regulations (ihr). The amendments can be seen here. The ihr and the new amendments if passed, are legally binding on the united states and on all united nations member states as a matter of international law. According to peter breggin md and ginger ross breggin in their report on this issue, these amendments will empower whos director-general to declare health emergencies or crises in any nation and to do so unilaterally and against the opposition of the target nation. The director-general will be able to declare these health crises based merely on his personal opinion or consideration that there is a potential or possible threat to other nations. The amendments eliminate the requirement to consult with the affected member state. In addition, the who will be empowered to collaborate with other nations to deal with a declared health crisis even against the wishes of the affected nation. Americas frontline doctors (aflds) position statement on these amendments puts it this way, the who would have the power to decide what constitutes a pandemic and to decide quarantine measures on a global scale. Who would control the development and safety of new treatments and would decide vaccine mandates for each country! . . . The proposed amendments empower the corrupt director-general to unilaterally declare a health emergency in any nation even against the opinion of that nation for any illness that is widespread. Incredibly, the biden administration proposed the amendments. According to aflds position paper, this amendment . . . Will serve to give away our countrys healthcare system, national sovereignty, and personal freedoms to the who on a silver platter. Americas frontline doctors (aflds) strongly opposes the creation and implementation of any treaty or international instrument that governs world pandemic preparedness and response. Succinctly put, the upshot of these amendments is to surrender sovereignty to the who regarding very broadly defined public health crises subject to the whim of the who director-general. The current director-general is not even a physician and is wholly unqualified. Even if he were qualified there is no scenario in which this ends well. According to peter hoekstra former chairman and ranking member of the house intelligence committee and more recently us ambassador to the netherlands during the trump administration, . . . This next pandemic is neither far off nor a hypothetical conspiracy theory. According to multiple credible reports from the u. S. Department of state, to the executive director of the australian strategic policy institute, peter jennings, china has been preparing for bio-warfare using pathogens for more than six years. It is no surprise that one of the amendments requires transferring genetic sequence data to the who. In fact, the trump administration pulled out of the who primarily because of its mistakes at the beginning of the covid pandemic, including its deferential approach towards china. According to hoekstra, tedros, the first non-physician director-general of who, is an extremely controversial marxist activist and politician from ethiopia installed by the chinese communist party. Placing our health policies in the hands of this man in particular who is beholden to the chinese communists is terrifying indeed. We must do everything in our power to stop these amendments from being ratified.																
302	0	Pfizers secret report on the covid vaccine. Beyond manslaughter. The evidence is overwhelming. The vaccine should be immediately withdrawn worldwide dylan eleven dylan eleven may 19, 2022 3 min pfizers secret report on the covid vaccine. Beyond manslaughter. The evidence is overwhelming. The vaccine should be immediately withdrawn worldwide tap news / weaver prof michel chossudovsky and caroline mailloux  lux media and global research may 17, 2022 the following video interview with prof. Michel chossudovsky pertains to the confidential pfizer report released as part of a freedom of information (foi) procedure. The report is a bombshell. The vaccine was launched in mid-december 2020. By the end of february 2021, pfizer had already received more than 1,200 reports of deaths allegedly caused by the vaccine and tens of thousands of reported adverse events, including 23 cases of spontaneous abortions out of 270 pregnancies and more than 2,000 reports of cardiac disorders. This confidential pfizer report provides data on deaths and adverse events recorded by pfizer from the outset of the vaccine project in december 2020 to the end of february 2021, namely a very short period (at most two and a half months). What is contained in pfizers confidential report is detailed evidence on the impacts of the vaccine on mortality and morbidity. This data which emanates from the horses mouth can now be used to confront as well formulate legal procedures against big pharma, the governments, the who and the media. Video interview with prof. Michel chossudovsky on the secret pfizer report  among all major big pharma actors, pfizer has a criminal record in the u. S. Can we trust a big pharma vaccine conglomerate which pleaded guilty to criminal charges by the us department of justice (doj) including fraudulent marketing and felony violation of the food, drug and cosmetic act? National health authorities claim that the covid-19 vaccine will save lives. Thats a lie. There is a worldwide upward trend of vaccine deaths and injuries. The latest official figures (april 3, 2022) point to approximately: 69,053 covid-19 injection related deaths and 10,997,085 injuries for the eu, us and uk combined for a population of 830 million people based on reported cases. Only a small fraction of the victims or families of the deceased will go through the tedious process of reporting vaccine related deaths and adverse events to the national health authorities. Based on historical data (electronic support for public healthvaccine adverse event reporting system (esp: vaers, p. 6): adverse events from drugs and vaccines are common, but underreported. ... Less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the food and drug administration (fda). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. (emphasis added) this confidential pfizer report released as part of a freedom of information (foi) procedure provides data on deaths and adverse events recorded by pfizer from the outset of the vaccine project in december 2020 to the end of february 2021, namely a very short period (at most two and a half months). The pfizer biontech vaccine was launched in the us on the 14th of december after the granting of emergency use authorization on december 11, 2020. In a twisted irony, the data revealed in this insider report refutes the official vaccine narrative peddled by the governments and the who. It also confirms the analysis of numerous medical doctors and scientists who have revealed the devastating consequences of the mrna vaccine. What is contained in pfizers confidential report is detailed evidence on the impacts of the vaccine on mortality and morbidity. This data which emanates from the horses mouth can now be used to confront as well formulate legal procedures against big pharma, the governments, the who and the media. In a court of law, the evidence contained in this big pharma confidential report (coupled with the data on deaths and adverse events compiled by the national authorities in the eu, uk and us) is irrefutable: because it is their data and their estimates and not ours. Bear in mind: its data which is based on reported and recorded cases, which constitute a small percentage of the actual number of vaccine related deaths and adverse events. This is a de facto mea culpa on the part of pfizer. #yes it is a killer vaccine pfizer was fully aware that the mrna vaccine which it is marketing worldwide would result in a wave of mortality and morbidity. This is tantamount to a crime against humanity on the part of big pharma. Pfizer knew from the outset that it was a killer vaccine. It is also a mea culpa and treason on the part of corrupt national governments worldwide which are being threatened and bribed by big pharma. No attempt has been made by the governments to call for the withdrawal of the killer vaccine. People are told that the vaccine is intended to save lives.																
303	0	Just about everything we have been told about covid is a lie or lies by omission. We are told the vaccine is the only way to beat covid. We are also told there are no other treatments available. Those are lies. We are not told that the so-called vaccine is experimental and that all these so-called vaccines were only approved on an emergency basis. We are not told that these vaccines permanently alter your dna with genetic engineering and that vaccine manufacturers have zero liability if you are permanently injured or die from a shot. Also, manufacturers of these so-called vaccines and the medical community have no idea what the effects will be in the short or long term. This makes what is going on today around america, with vaccine centers to push an unproven medical test, a huge reckless risk. Instead of giving the public actual information for informed consent, an idea that came out of the 1947 nurnberg trials of nazis, we have what i call misinformed consent based on lies, fraud and fear. The nazis would be proud. Youtube has taken down another lifesaving video about the wonder drug called ivermectin. This is an anti-viral drug that is decades old. Its been proven safe with little downside risk when treating and preventing covid19. Dr. Pierre kory testified in the senate about repurposing ivermectin and the mountains of evidence showing the miraculous effectiveness of ivermectin. The public is not allowed to hear alternatives to experimental vaccines. As i said last week, debates and alternative scientific information is not allowed. Youtube has taken down the senate testimony of dr. Kory (but you can watch it here) to censor any and all scientific alternatives to vaccines. The economy is getting betternot. Another 684,000 initial unemployment claims were reported this week. Some financial experts are excited because it was not more than 700,000 claims. Not what i would consider a cause for celebration. Also, a huge cargo ship is blocking a major shipping choke point, and that is causing big economic problems in an already fragile global economy. Join greg hunter of usawatchdog.

304	0	Dr sherri tenpenny has mapped out ten mechanisms of action of how the mrna vaccine is going to kill people. She says, when you inject the mrna, the messenger rna starts to code for the spike protein... The nih is now fighting with moderna over patent rights, because you cant patent anything thats out in nature, so they had to manipulate the spike protein, in order to be able to patent it and then make an antibody to the spike protein. Well, this anti-spike protein antibody is deadly. Its absolutely deadly. And the first three papers i went through, i found that one of the things the spike protein does is it directly attacks lung tissue and breaks it down. The second thing that it does is it inhibits your m2 macrophages, which are your anti-inflammatory macrophages, so you get cytokine storm and you die. The third is that when that messenger rna goes in and makes an antibody to the spike protein, it binds it loosely, carries it into a cell and causes permanent replication. So its like having an on button with no off button. Youre constantly making this little piece of protein develop more spike proteins against it, make more destruction. And then, with this paper that i read last night, of this anti-spike protein, it attacks the astrocytes and the oligodendrocytes, which are two different kinds of cells in your brain. Two different kinds of central nervous system [cells]. It attacks the inner mitochondria membrane, in two different mechanisms and it attacks this neurofilament protein, which are the motor nerves, which suddenly weve seen those people [with strong tremors], its because the spike protein antibody is affecting their motor neurons and their central nervous system. And then the primary, number one symptom that people have after they get this vaccine is debilitating fatigue, that they cant even function in the main part of their lives. Well, its because the spike protein antibody attacks the mitochondria and it attacks the gad 65, which is the intracellular antigen inside of your mitochondria and it can also attack you pancreas. If youre diabetic, itll make your diabetes worse. If youre not diabetic, it can cause you to have diabetes, stiff-person syndrome, cerebellar ataxia, which is what thing that youre watching [massive tremors]; people not able to walk. In the experiment that they did, they took different tissue antigens, like skin and lung and all this other stuff and then they dropped the serum that had the antibody all over it. 27 out of 55 of the tissue types reacted adversely to the spike antibody. So you get this vaccine, you create this antibody, thats why in the most recent vaers report that came out this week, 181 deaths, already that have been reported and when you start reading through them, you kind of lay out what these antibodies do, you can see it, right in the vaers report, what has happened to these people and its the anti-spike antibody thats attacking them and thats why the most number of deaths occurred about 19 days after the injection, because it takes a while to develop the antibody response. It doesnt happen just like that. Unless you have an anaphylactic reaction  probably to the polyethylene glycol unless you have an immediate reaction to it, the delayed reaction is going to start  it takes a while  i talked to a bunch of epidemiologists in europe and they said that it takes about 48 weeks to really see the most profound effects of autoimmune disease. When i found the first four mechanisms of action, i said to a few friends of mine, this is a perfectly-designed kill machine. Perfectly-designed, because  the other thing is with that replicating thing, because with the vaccine, youre going to see mutants [of covid]. So now, were all talking about the mutants. The one thing theyre not asking these people, whove been diagnosed with this mutant strain, is have you had one of the not-approved vaccines? Nobodys putting that together. So, yes, 48 weeks  so its somewhere between 48 weeks, so its about a year and 6 to 7 months and a couple of years into the future. So, like you were talking about the girl with meningitis vaccine? This is going to be even worse. So people have got to make some serious spiritual decisions about this... Are you going to say, oh, i want to get the vaccine so i can get on an airplane, or so i can go out to eat, or i can keep my job. That gets a little harder. Or so i can continue in professional school, which gets a little bit harder. People are going to have to start making some really hard spiritual decisions about this.																
305	0	The pandemic was planned, and is "a crime against humanity. " "we have now a whistleblower inside the cms, and we have two whistleblowers in the cdc, " the doctor revealed. "we think we have 50,000 dead americans. Fifty thousand deaths. So we actually have more deaths due to the vaccine per day than certainly the viral illness by far. It's basically propagandized bioterrorism by injection. " dr. Mccullough: covid vaccines have already killed up to 50,000 americans, according to whistleblowers by debra heine (henrymakow. Com) in an extraordinary interview last week, dr. Peter mccullough, an american professor of medicine and vice chief of internal medicine at baylor university, declared that the world has been subjected to a form of bioterrorism, and that the suppression of early treatments for covid-19--such as hydroxychloroquine-- "was tightly linked to the development of a vaccine. " dr. Mccullough made the explosive comments during a webinar on june 11, with dr. Reiner fuellmich, a german trial lawyer, who believes the pandemic was planned, and is "a crime against humanity. " mccullough said he believes the bioterrorism has come in two stages--the first wave being the rollout of the coronavirus, and the second, the rollout of the dangerous vaccines, which he said may already be responsible for the deaths of up to 50,000 americans. Dr. Mccullough practices internal medicine and cardiology, is the editor of reviews in cardiovascular medicine, senior editor of the american journal of cardiology, editor of the textbook cardiorenal medicine, and president of the cardiorenal society. "the first wave of the bioterrorism is a respiratory virus that spread across the world, and affected relatively few people--about one percent of many populations--but generated great fear, " mccullough explained during the oval media webinar with other doctors. He noted that the virus targeted "mostly the frail and the elderly, but for otherwise well people, it was much like having the common cold. " dr. Mccullough later elaborated that he has treated many patients with the disease, written papers on it, had the disease himself, and has also seen a death in his own family due to covid. The doctor said he believes that fear of the virus was used very quickly to generate policies that would hugely impact human life, such as the draconian lockdowns. "every single thing that was done in public health in response to the pandemic made it worse, " he pointed out. Mccullough explained that early on, as a doctor treating covid patients, he came up with an early treatment regimen for those struck with the virus, which reduced hospital stays by about 85 percent, and said he began publishing papers on what he had learned. The doctor noted that he was "met with resistance at all levels" in terms of actually treating patients and publishing his papers. "fortunately i had enough publication strength to publish the only two papers in the entire medical literature that teaches doctors how to treat covid-19 patients at home to prevent hospitalization, " he said. Masked-child. Jpeg "what we have discovered is that the suppression of early treatment was tightly linked to the development of a vaccine, and the entire program--and in a sense, bioterrorism phase one-- was rolled out, [and] was really about keeping the population in fear, and in isolation preparing them to accept the vaccine, which appears to be phase two of a bioterrorism operation. " mccullough explained that both the coronavirus and the vaccines deliver "to the human body, the spike protein, [which is] the gain of function target of this bioterrorism research. " he acknowledged that he couldn't come out and say all that on national television because the medical establishment has done such a thorough job of propagandizing the issue. "what we have learned over time is that we could no longer communicate with government agencies. We actually couldn't communicate with our propagandized colleagues in major medical centers, all of which appear to be under a spell, almost as if they've been hypnotized. " vax-preg. Jpeg "good doctors are doing unthinkable things like injecting biologically active messenger rna that produces this pathogenic spike protein into pregnant women. I think when these doctors wake up up from their trance, they're going to be shocked to think what they've done to people, " he said, echoing what he, and dr. Harvey risch, professor at the yale school of public health, told fox news host laura ingraham during an interview last month. Mccullough told fuellmich that last summer, he started an early treatment initiative to keep covid patients out of the hospital, which involved organizing multiple groups of medical doctors in the united states and abroad. The doctor noted that some governments tried to block these doctors from providing the treatments, but with the help of the association of physicians and surgeons, they were able to put out a home patient guide, and in the u. S. , organized four different tele-medical services, and fifteen regional tele-medical services. This way, people who were stricken with covid-19, were able to call in to these services and get the medications they needed prescribed to local pharmacies, or mail order distribution pharmacies, he explained. "without the government really even understanding what was going on, we crushed the epidemic curve of the united states, " mccullough claimed. "toward the end of december and january, we basically took care of the pandemic with about 500 doctors and telemedicine services, and to this day, we treat about 25 percent of the u. S. Covid-19 population that are actually at high risk, over age 50 with medical problems that present with severe symptoms. " the doctor said that his belief that the suppression of early treatment was "tightly linked" to the vaccines, is what that led him to focus his attention on warning the public about the vaccines. "we know that this is phase two of bioterrorism, we don't know who's behind it, but we know that they want a needle in every arm to inject messenger rna, or adenoviral dna into every human being, " he said. "they want every human being. " the doctor later warned that the experimental vaccines could ultimately lead to cancers, and sterilize young women. Dr. Mccullough said his goal is to set apart a large group of people that the system can not get to, which would include those who have already had the virus, those with immunity, children, pregnant women, and child-bearing women. The cardiologist went on to say that because there is no clinical benefit in young people whatsoever to get the vaccine, even one case of myocarditis or pericarditis following the shots "is too many, " yet even though the cdc is aware of hundreds of alarming reports of cases of heart swelling in teenagers and young adults, they're only going to reevaluate the matter later on in june. He accused the medical establishment of neglecting to to do anything to reduce the risks of the vaccines. As someone who has chaired over two dozen vaccine safety monitoring boards for the fda, and national institute for health, mccullough had room to criticize how the vaccines have been rolled out. "with this program, there is no critical event committee, there is no data-safety monitoring board, and there's no human ethics committee. Those structures are mandatory for all large clinical investigations, and so the word that's really used for what's going on is malfeasance, that's wrongdoing of people in authority, " the doctor explained. "without any safety measures in place, you can see what's going on, " he continued. "basically it's the largest application of a biological product with the greatest amount of morbidity and mortality in the history of our country. " "we are at over 5,000 deaths so far, as you know, and i think about 15,000 hospitalizations. In the eu it's over 10,000 deaths. We are working with the center for medicaid (cms) data, and we have a pretty good lead that the real number is tenfold. " mccullough explained that because the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) database only amounts to about 10 percent of the bad reactions to the vaccines, his team has had to go to other sources for information. "we have now a whistleblower inside the cms, and we have two whistleblowers in the cdc, " the doctor revealed. "we think we have 50,000 dead americans. Fifty thousand deaths. So we actually have more deaths due to the vaccine per day than certainly the viral illness by far. It's basically propagandized bioterrorism by injection. " dr. Mccullough said he's seen people in his office with cases of portal vein thrombosis, myocarditis, and serious memory problems post-vaccination. "it's so disconcerting, " he said. He said he was recently viciously attacked in the media by a woman from singapore who is linked to the gates foundation. Dr. Mccullough went on to express a chilling theory that the vaccines could have been designed to reduce the world's population. "if you said this is all a gates foundation program to reduce the population, it's fitting very well with that hypothesis, right? The first wave was to kill the old people by the respiratory infection, the second wave is to take the survivors and target the young people and sterilize them, " he said. "if you notice the messaging in the country, in the united states, they're not even interested in old people now. They want the kids. They want the kids, kids, kids, kids kids! They're such a focus on the kids, " he said, noting that in toronto, canada, last month, they lured the children with promises of ice-cream to get the jab. According to one report, the government of ontario--which doesn't require parental consent for children to get vaccinated--encouraged the kids to get the pfizer vaccine at a pop-up vaccine event. "they held the parents back, and they were vaccinating the kids, " the doctor railed. He said his canadian wife's mother was forcibly vaccinated against her will. Mccullough predicted that the united states is gearing up to force people into getting the injections. ----- related - "chairman leng youbin, told a forum that sales [of infant milk] will drop sharply in the coming one and two years since many women can not bear children within six months of coronavirus vaccination, mainland media reported.

306	0	Cdc caught deleting 6,000 covid vaccine deaths from vaers website, report says by olivia cavallaro jul 23, 2021 02:56 pm edt share tweet covid vaccine (photo : hakan nural / unsplash) the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) is supposed to be the united states' primary voice of scientific reason in the face of the global pandemic, but a recent revelation reveals that the data it presents to people, particularly when it comes to vaccine-related casualties, is at best questionable. The cdc's constant changing of rules and guidelines surrounding covid has made some weary and doubtful of its authority. This is also in part due to the fact that while the cdc meticulously tracks who has and has not received a covid vaccine in the u. S. , it has failed to shed light on those who suffered major side effects from the experimental vaccines or even passed away from it. There has been a huge lack of push for investigation and study on those who have passed away after they received a covid vaccine. But citizens can keep track through the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers), a database co-managed by the cdc and fda. The vaers' role is to "[accept] and [analyze] reports of adverse events (possible side effects) after a person has received a vaccination. " it is a "passive reporting system" that "relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences to cdc and fda. " herein lies the problem: the vaers database showed on friday that there had been 11,140 reported deaths from the covid vaccine in the united states alone, the gateway pundit reported. This figure shows a slight increase from the 9,125 reported deaths reported last week. On wednesday, the cdc updated its website to indicate that "in the united states from december 14, 2020, through july 19, 2021, ... Vaers received 6,207 reports of death (0.0018%) among people who received a covid-19 vaccine. " on july 19, monday, however, the very same website, showed that "vaers received 12,313 reports of death (0.0036%) among people who received a covid-19 vaccine. " this is a staggering 6,000 post-vaccination deaths. This update can be seen at the internet archive. The numbers were again changed later within the same day, with the number of deaths down to 6,079 again. It's worth noting that the dates were also changed to only cover post-vaccination deaths between dec. 14, 2020 and july 13, 2021. If the data that was changed is accurate, it could mean that 6,000 vaccinated people died between july 13 and 19, which is a period of but six days. A video explaining the strange incident can be seen via infowars. It can also be accessed here. Infowars reported that a whistleblower recently filed a lawsuit saying that vaers underreports vaccine-related deaths by a factor of at least five, which means that the real number of covid vaccine deaths should be at about 45,000. The question of vaccine safety and efficacy is important now more than ever with the back to school season in the horizon and with the fda considering extending vaccine eligibility to children. But the wall street journal has some reservations about having kids vaccinated against covid, claiming that government policies are impacting children based on one statistic: the number of children under 18 who have died with a covid diagnosis code in their record. That statistic is 335. The report questioned why the cdc has failed to "[research] each death to find out whether covid caused it or if it involved a pre-existing medical condition. " instead, the cdc advisory committee on immunization practices went ahead in may to decide that the two doses of covid vaccine "outweigh the risks for all kids 12 to 15. " marty makary wrote for the wsj, "i've written hundreds of peer-reviewed medical studies, and i can think of no journal editor who would accept the claim that 335 deaths resulted from a virus without data to indicate if the virus was incidental or causal, and without an analysis of relevant risk factors such as obesity.

307	0	The vaccine death report reveals that millions of people have died from covid vaccines galleryposted on september 30, 2021 by multidimensionalocean 9 votes source:  thursday, september 30, 2021 by: ethan huff tags: badhealth, badmedicine, big pharma, biological weapon, conspiracy, covid, dangerous medicine, david john sorenson, deception, depopulation, genocide, pharmaceutical fraud, plandemic, the vaccine death report, vaers, vladimir zelenko bypass censorship by sharing this link: new copy url3,200views image: the vaccine death report reveals that millions of people have died from covid vaccines (natural news) drs. David john sorenson and vladimir zelenko have released a new report that suggests millions of people have already died from wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccines. While the official government count is only in the thousands, sorenson and zelenko say that the true number of serious adverse events caused by the shots is significantly higher. The vaccine death report, as they are calling it, sticks strictly to solid facts. There are no unfounded claims and the data presented is clear and verifiable. All associated references are included for proper peer review. The data shows that we are currently witnessing the greatest organized mass murder in the history of our world, the report states. The severity of this situation compels us to ask this critical question: will we rise up to the defense of billions of innocent people? Or will we permit personal profit over justice, and be complicit? Already, lawyers are networking to prepare class action lawsuits in response to the reports finding. This is a global genocide in action and many, sadly, still believe that it is about public safety. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are rising up against this criminal operation, the report states. To all who have been complicit so far, we say: there is still time to turn and choose the side of truth. Please make the right choice. Cdc health care fraud detection whistleblower says vaers wildly underreports vaccine injuries, deaths at the very least, there are five times more deaths from the jabs than are being reported. In all likelihood, the actual figure is much higher. The vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) currently logs more than half a million cases of severe side effects from the shots, including stroke, heart failure, blood clots, brain disorders, convulsions, seizures, inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, life-threatening allergic reactions, autoimmune disease, arthritis, miscarriage, infertility, rapid-onset muscle weakness, deafness, blindness, narcolepsy and cataplexy. That half a million figure was from back in august, by the way. The latest numbers, once they get released, are likely to be much higher. And again, this is only a fraction of the true overall number of incidents that never even make it into vaers. A health care fraud detection expert from the u. S. Centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recently came forward with a sworn testimony about how the vaers database, while extremely useful, is under-reported by a conservative factor of at least 5. Part of the problem is that deaths are only attributed to the vaccines if they occur outside of a two-week window. Those that occur within that window are not logged because the cdc does not consider a person vaccinated until 14 days have passed post-injection. On top of that, a private researcher told sorenson and zelenko that there are at least 150,000 cases that are missing from the vaers database entirely. Nobody knows how many of these are injuries and how many are deaths, but it is suspicious nonetheless. The vaers database only captures about one percent of vaccine adverse events to begin with, so the numbers provided there are definitively too low. Extrapolating the data reveals that millions of potential cases of vaccine injury and death are simply missing from the official reporting. Adverse events from drugs and vaccines are common, but underreported, says harvard pilgrim health care inc. Although 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the food and drug administration (fda). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. The latest news about the wave of injuries and deaths caused by chinese virus shots can be found at chemicalviolence.

308	0	The variety of covid deaths may be the best lie in historical past. Ninety-five percent of the deaths are from causes other than covid, with vaccine deaths surpassing covid deaths considerably. The heart for illness management (cdc) is presenting numbers which might be removed from the reality. In belgium, de tijd journal wrote that whereas the federal government claimed that 3,000 aged individuals had died from covid, only three percent had been tested. This is able to imply that solely 90 of the three,000 may need been optimistic, though the nation was positioned on lockdown. That is what the italian politician vittorio sgarbi exclaims: lets not make this the chamber of lies. Dont lie! Inform the reality. Dont say theres 25,000 lifeless. Its not true. Dont use the lifeless for rhetoric and terrorism. Figures from the larger institute of well being say 96.3 % died of different illnesses. Underreported adversarial vaccine occasions a cdc healthcare fraud detection knowledgeable reviews that the variety of deaths ensuing from the covid-19 experimental injections is at least five times more than the cdc claims: ive, during the last 25 years, developed over 100 distinct healthcare fraud detection algorithms. ... Its my skilled estimate that vaers (the vaccine adversarial occasion reporting system) database, whereas extraordinarily helpful, is under-reported by a conservative issue of at the least 5. ... And have assessed that the deaths occurring inside three days of vaccination are increased than these reported in vaers by an element of at the least 5. In response to the whistleblower, the cdc is equally underreporting other adverse allergic reactions by 50 to 120 times. This is able to imply that the demise charge from vaccines by mid-september was not 15,386 as reported by the cdc, however at the least 77,000. Dr. Jane ruby additionally warns that different vaccine doses carry different mrna content. Under is an account of the demise report abstract and statistics, scientific proof of the consequences of vaccines, together with doable alteration of human dna, the world knowledgeable warning to humanity, and the doable presence of higher covid-19 therapy. The covid vaccine demise report abstract a non-public researcher decided that some authentic demise data and numbers have been deleted and switched, respectively, on the vaers database for milder public reactions. As accredited by the 2009 lazarus report from harvard pilgrim well being care inc. , the cdc has a history of hiding the real effects of vaccinations and deceptive the general public, as was proven within the case of autism. Though 25 % of ambulatory sufferers expertise an adversarial drug occasion, lower than 0.3 % of all adversarial drug occasions and 1-13 % of significant occasions are reported to the meals and drug administration (fda). Likewise, fewer than 1 % of vaccine adversarial occasions are reported. And within the case of covid-19, the cdc makes use of the nr 1 method to hide the many deaths that result from the vaers injections. Vaccinated individuals that die after the primary and earlier than the second injection should not thought-about among the many variety of vaccine deaths. Causes behind underreporting adversarial occasions underreporting such incidences is prevalent as a result of many individuals should not conscious that reviews on the consequences of vaccines can be found. However primarily, many medical practitioners that try to tell the general public face unrelenting media battle by name-calling, lack of jobs, arrests as theyre labeled home terrorists, deletion of their social platforms, and in some instances, demise threats. As an illustration, knowledgeable scientists like dr. Rob elens, who the federal government has threatened with a lack of license; dr. David brownstein, who has had his blogs eliminated; dr. Joseph mercola, who has been burned on google and compelled to delete his content material; and dr. Zelenko, who has been slandered on the web, for treating covid with none of the obtainable covid vaccines. Nonetheless, many medical consultants have, in a technique or one other, managed to share the adversarial results of covid-19 vaccination, like demise and alteration of dna. Different medical practitioners conscious of those results dont have any motivation to report the influence of incapacity or demise following vaccination. They concern being held accountable for not informing sufferers of the chance they take by getting vaccinated. In different instances, medical consultants get medical incentives in the event that they promote vaccination. And due to the 100% safety from all legal responsibility agreements made by governments worldwide, vaccine producers will face no authorized motion following these vaccine-related deaths. Moreover, insurance coverage covers dont present compensation for any results skilled from the administration of vaccines. Regardless of the various vaccine deaths, no particular person or occasion shall be liable. Covid vaccine statistics a moderna whistleblower took a confidential screenshot at work that confirmed within three months, there were 300,000 adverse events following the launch of the mordena covid-19 vaccine. This info was undisclosed. Scott jensen, the minnesota senator, and a practising doctor, mentioned on fox information that many hospitals in the u. S. Receive financial incentives to register their sufferers as covid sufferers: $39,000 for each affected person. A funeral director within the u. Okay. Reported that he by no means noticed a rise in deaths throughout the pandemic. However when he began getting calls, not one of the people labeled as covid deaths had been examined for the virus. As an alternative, a nurse mentioned that they had been instructed to manage lethal doses of vaccines to the elderly. Folks run over by vehicles, coronary heart assaults, and most cancers sufferers had been additionally labeled as covid sufferers. The lancet examine additionally exhibits that the delta variant is still transmitted among the vaccinated. Thats why the cdc mandated masks for the vaccinated as a result of they carried the identical variant because the unvaccinated, with many more and more testing optimistic for covid. Covid vaccine demise statistics covid vaccine incapacity statistics as of august 18, 2021, the official reviews of eudravigilance within the european union present that at least 1 million people suffered adverse effects while 22,000 died from vaccination. In an unofficial and unpopular citizen platform in the netherlands, about 1,200 individuals were permanently disabled, and 1,600 died from vaccination. After the primary wave of vaccination within the u. Okay. , at least 1,260 people lost their sight, miscarriages elevated by 366 % amongst vaccinated moms, and 30,305 died inside three weeks of vaccination. As printed by the british authorities, different adverse side effects of vaccination include loss of sight, coronary heart failure, miscarriages, paralysis, and autoimmune illnesses. Different research, like the new england journal of medication research, show that heart inflammation, infertility, and decreased sperm depend improve after administration of vaccination. Theres a further examine that states that vaccination causes cancer. These statistics are solely the tip of the iceberg. The science behind covid vaccines vaccine developer, geert vanden bossche, chief scientific officer at univac, warns that the injections can compromise the immunity of humans and make them extra inclined to different infections. As an illustration, the college of san francisco examine exhibits that vaccination increases the number of proteins in the human body which causes blood clots that lead to strokes and coronary heart assaults. Moreover, theres concern that vaccination is birthing new variants of the an infection, with the individuals who obtain two doses of the identical vaccine being probably the most in danger. When studied below a microscope, dr. Carrie madej discovered that vaccine vials from moderna and johnson & johnson confirmed a living organism with tentacles moving around, self-assembling nanoparticles, and items of graphene. Throughout a scientific convention within the netherlands, the pfizer vaccine vial additionally confirmed a sizable living organism with many others shifting round. These tiny organisms then conjoin to type different massive organisms. In response to andreas klecker, the world-renowned biophysicist, the content of graphene in vaccines is 95 percent. It is sufficient to change the electromagnetic area in people, thus altering the traditional functioning of physique organs. The spasm impact of getting vaccinated is a results of this alteration. Dr. Robert younger additionally concluded that other toxins present in vaccines embrace peg, lnp capsids, aluminum, and parasites. One other examine discovered that the mrna vaccine alters the blood of the vaccinated within 24 hours by forming crystalized pink blood cells often called heinz our bodies. These are the exact words of mark zuckerberg: we simply dont know the long-term unwanted side effects of principally modifying folkss dna and rna to instantly encode in an individuals dna and rna, principally the flexibility to provide these antibodies and whether or not that causes different mutations or different dangers downstream. In response to dr. Chinda brandolino, if the dna of any human is altered, they are no longer considered humans but transhumans. As such, they relinquish any human rights and turn into inclined to being thought-about property to the patent holder. These are the people that alter and might patent the rna and the dna. And now, a number of the youngsters born in mexico of vaccinated mother and father have pitch-black eyes, they usually age too quick. South american scientists try to find out if these infants are examples of transhumanism. In response to the chilean president sebastian pinera, 5g is a gateway for machines to read our thoughts and manipulate thoughts and feelings in humans. In his promotional movies, klaus schwab says this about the near future: youll personal nothing, dont have any privateness, and youll be comfortable. In its most pessimistic, dehumanized type, the fourth industrial revolution might certainly have the potential to robotize humanity and thus deprive us of our hearts and soul. However as a complement to the very best components of human naturecreativity, empathy, stewardshipit will probably additionally raise humanity into a brand new collective and ethical consciousness based mostly on a shared sense of future. Its incumbent on us all to verify the latter prevails. For 5g to achieve this functionality, it requires nanoparticles contained in the human mind. That is the place vaccines is available in. Graphene oxide, the substance considerably current in covid-19 vaccines, is the most efficient substance for communicating with 5g. Because of this inbrain neuro electronics uses graphene oxide to manipulate the human brain for medical functions, primarily to revive the mind. In response to the corporate highlights, the expertise can learn, detect neural patterns, and management mind perform. The aim is to attach humanity to synthetic intelligence to usher in a brand new world order the place people dont have any privateness or freedom of speech or expression. As an alternative, theyre to be subjected to at least one collective consciousness below one rule of thought and precept. This can be a plan to manage the complete world. Who is accountable? The documentary monopoly (discovered on stopworldcontrol. Com) exhibits that every part is owned by a choose group of people whose key to energy is secrecy in order that no one can contact them. These elite, prosperous society members have strategically purchased entities in each trade, from healthcare to journey and meals, thus, giving them the flexibility to run a worldwide monopoly. In addition they personal large tech companies like apple and fb and main information media shops. Due to this fact, folks like invoice gates and mark zuckerberg, individually wealthy, additionally work below the directions of the elite. The elite then creates world organizations to make use of as a entrance for his or her hidden world domination agendas by these influential public people. Good examples are who and the united nations. One other instance is the banking imperium, which controls cash globally. At present, the elite group has paid the nigerian authorities considerably to make sure solely the vaccinated have entry to banking companies. Warnings from world consultants in response to world consultants like nobel prize winner in medication, dr. Luc montagnier, the world might be facing the most extraordinary global genocide risk in historical past. Even dr. Robert malone, the inventor of the mrna expertise used within the injections, warns of their adversarial results. Web sites like thecovidworld. Com present that many individuals die from the moderna vaccine in numbers not current in historic data. The severity of those results instigates the necessity to warn humanity. Is there a higher answer? Probably the most cited microbiologist in europe, world-famous french professor didier raoult, successfully treated covid patients with hydroxychloroquine. This drug is well-known for its efficacy and security in treating coronaviruses. The worlds foremost knowledgeable on infectious illnesses efficiently handled hundreds of sufferers with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, they usually recovered, save for just a few aged with prior morbidities. Like raoults success, dr. Rob elens, from the netherlands, used hydroxychloroquine and zinc and saw a 100 percent recovery of his covid sufferers. Dr. Vladimir zelenko from new york used hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin on more than 500 patients who recovered successfully. And now, the zelenko protocol is getting used to avoid wasting many lives by the telemedicine platform. One other successful treatment for covid, as utilized by biophysicist andreas kalcker in latin american nations, is chlorine dioxide. This decreased the demise charge from 100 to 0. Tons of of research verify the effectiveness of hcq in treating covid-19 and stopping hospitalization and demise. Moreover, 63 peer-reviewed research show the effectiveness of ivermectin in treating covid-19. There is hope but the world is experiencing an awesome awakening amongst physicians, scientists, teachers, legal professionals, entrepreneurs, and politicians. The awakening helps combating towards ignorance and deception in favor of fact and freedom. Moreover, many healthcare practitioners are refusing vaccine mandates following the demise reviews and the revelation of the hidden truths of the science behind covid-19 vaccines. Many people at the moment are standing up amidst concern to talk up for the reality by informing different people. In any case, info is energy.																
309	0	Claim: covid vaccines installed marburg payloads in human victims; 5g broadcast signal will activate the bioweapon, unleashing the next raging pandemic 04/25/2022 / by mike adams todays situation update podcast covers several key stories, including the worsening of food shortages around the world (with indonesia now banning all exports of edible oils, including palm oil) and russias claim that the united states is about to launch a false flag chemical attack in kiev or kharkov in order to escalate the war by blaming russia. But the main discussion in todays podcast centers around a jeffrey prather interview that aired on brighteon. Tv last week, when prather invited guest attorney todd callender to offer his latest intel on what he believes is about to take place on the pandemic front. If you watch the following interview video from 15:00  18:00, youll get the most relevant part of that information, in which callender explains what he thinks is coming: this is all extremely important to understand for a couple of reasons. First, jeffrey prather carefully vets his guests, so this isnt some hare-brained fringe theory from an unknown source. Secondly, callenders claims have a basis in fact, found in cdc documents and even terms of service contracts from amazon, among other companies. While the claims may sound outlandish, they are plausible and need to be considered. Chimeric marburg payloads to be unleashed by 5g signals? In his interview with prather, callender states that he believes people injected with mrna vaccines (which arent really vaccines) were actually installed with nanotechnology carrying chimeric virus payloads that may include elements of marburg virus. According to callender, a broadcast from 5g cell towers at 18 mhz, for a specific duration and sequence, will cause affected cells to rupture, unleashing marburg payload bioweapons into the blood of those who took the mrna injections. This, in turn, would instantly unleash a marburg pandemic and produce a sudden rush of symptoms including bleeding out (hemorrhagic fever isnt pretty), cardiovascular deaths, seizures and more. Some of the symptoms that could appear would even resemble classic zombies as depicted in pop culture: biting, loss of cognitive function, aggression, confusion and extreme alterations in the appearance of skin and eyes, among other similarities. (such symptoms may also appear to be libs of tiktok, so dont be confused... ) callenders claim that the cdc has produced zombie apocalypse warning documents is confirmed and true. We covered the cdc zombie story a decade ago, and since then, similar zombie apocalypse warnings have shown up in terms of service documents from companies like amazon. See this real headline, kansas governor declares october zombie preparedness month; urges citizens to prepare for zombie apocalypse. If this theory pans out, the obvious timeframe for the powers that be to release the binary weapon would be before the mid-term elections taking place later this year. With a whole new pandemic hitting the scene  with far more serious symptoms and a higher death rate compared to covid  the elections could either be cancelled or altered into a universal vote-from-home format which would favor the highly organized vote rigging and ballot counterfeiting of the democrats (who are only in power because they stole the last election, of course). Critics might say this all smacks of science fiction. But we are living through a science fiction dystopian scenario right now, with extreme censorship, an orwellian global cabal trying to exterminate the human race, the rise of the robots and the mass injection of billions of people with exotic nanotechnology that seems to have a rather nefarious purpose, far from merely offering immunity. The use of external signals to control neural implants using nanotechnology is well described in patents and the medical literature it is also easily confirmed that modern medical science has run many medical experiments on using external electromagnetic fields to control nanowire neurological implants in mammals. Look up the research on super paramagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (spions), or magneto nanoparticles used in mice experiments. See this story from 2021: graphene-based neuromodulation technology is real: press release from inbrain neuroelectronics describes brain controlling biocircuits using ai-powered graphene. Or check out the numerous patents from dr. Charles lieber, and youll discover a deep rabbit hole of exotic technology that describes nanostructure neurological implants with self-assembling circuitry that can interface with human biology. See my article and podcast, harvard scientist dr. Charles lieber, nanowires, dod, ccp, wuhan, covid, 5g, carbon nanotubes (cnt), military vaccines, spfn spike ferritin nanoparticles and more. None of that is science fiction. Its all science fact, as evidenced by the uspto (patent office) records. Heres a partial list of patents from dr.

310	0	Nearly 1.3 million adverse events linked to covid-19 vaccines, reveal vaers reports 05/25/2022 / by zoey sky the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) on friday, may 20, released new data showing a total of 1,268,008 reports of adverse events linked to the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccines. The reports were submitted between december 14, 2020 and may 13, 2022 to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers), the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in america. Despite the alarming number of cases linked to coronavirus vaccines, the cdc signed off on a third booster dose for children aged five to 11. The vaers data shows a total of 28,141 reports of deaths, which points to an increase of 173 over the previous week; and 230,364 serious injuries, which has gone up by 1,887 compared to the previous week. Overall, there were 6,859 additional total adverse events reported to vaers over the previous week. With the exception of foreign reports to vaers, 817,538 adverse events were reported in the u. S. Between december 14, 2020, and may 13, 2022. The reports include 12,961 deaths and 82,544 serious injuries. Foreign reports refer to reports foreign subsidiaries send to vaccine manufacturers in the country. Under food and drug administration (fda) regulations, if a manufacturer is notified of a foreign case report that describes an event that is both serious and is not documented on the products labeling, the manufacturer is required to submit the report to vaers. Out of the 12,961 deaths in the u. S. Reported as of may 13, 16 percent occurred within 24 hours of vaccination; 20 percent occurred within 48 hours of vaccination; and 59 percent occurred in individuals who experienced an onset of symptoms within 48 hours of inoculation. (related: the highwire: covid booster drives in other countries contributed to higher mortality rates. ) around 581 million coronavirus vaccine doses had been administered in the u. S. As of may 13. This includes 343 million doses of pfizer, 219 million doses of moderna and 19 million doses of johnson & johnson (j&j). Every friday, vaers publishes vaccine injury reports received by a specified date. All reports submitted to vaers must then be investigated thoroughly before a causal relationship can be confirmed. However, vaers has historically been shown to report only one percent of actual vaccine adverse events. Meanwhile, vaers data for five- to 11-year-olds as of may 13 revealed that: there had been 10,745 adverse events, along with 279 cases rated as serious and five reported deaths. There had been 22 reports of myocarditis or inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis or inflammation of the outer lining of the heart. Over the previous week, reports of myocarditis and pericarditis had been removed by the cdc from the vaers system in this age group without any explanation provided. There had been 43 reports of blood clotting disorders. Cdc vaccine advisory panel endorses pfizer booster dose for kids aged 5 to 11 on thursday, may 19, the cdcs independent vaccine advisory panel endorsed a third dose of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine for children ages five to 11. Cdc director dr. Rochelle walensky signed off on the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) recommendation. This means healthcare workers can now start administering the third dose of covid-19 boosters. The acip recommendation came two days after the fda granted pfizers request for emergency use authorization (eua) of a single booster dose for the same age group after claiming that the third shot should be administered at least five months after the initial two-dose primary series with the pfizer vaccine. The fda granted the eua without meeting with its vaccine advisory panel of independent experts to discuss pfizers data on children aged five to 11. Instead, the authorization was based on a study subset of only 67 children who exhibited higher antibody levels a month after being given a booster dose. Along with the small study subset for the pfizer booster, the fda granted eua for the boosters even though data indicated showing higher infection rates among fully vaccinated children in the five-to-11 age group compared to unvaccinated children. Additionally, there are still no studies testing the efficacy of the vaccine against the current dominant ba.2 covid-19 variant. There are also two new studies that reveal that for vaccinated individuals who are infected with the omicron variant, the infection provides better protection against future infections than a second booster dose. The fda said it did not identify any new safety concerns and that the children in the trial experienced the same mild side effects others did after getting a booster dose. A subset of only 67 children is too small to effectively detect potential adverse events like myocarditis. It also remains to be seen how rapidly any protection provided wanes because trial participants were not followed beyond 28 days. Visit vaccines. News for more news related to covid-19 vaccines.

311	0	Shock: pfizer tried to hide data showing its covid vax caused massive increase in miscarriages, stillborn babies 04/24/2022 / by jd heyes in recent weeks, big pharma giant pfizer, with an assist from the biden justice department, went to court to shield certain safety data from the general public for at least 55 years, a shocking attempt at secrecy the likes that americans havent seen since the jfk cover-up. Fortunately for advocates of transparency, a federal judge saw through pfizer and ordered the company to begin releasing its data by the tens of thousands of pages per week. An analysis of the first batch of data released shows exactly why pfizer wanted to keep it hidden for decades (or longer): it is devastating and, frankly, should be grounds for massive lawsuits. As noted by celeste mcgovern at lifesite news, among the first documents turned over to the public is a cumulative analysis of post-authorization adverse event reports describing events reported to pfizer up until february 2021. She adds: it reveals that the drug behemoth received more than 150,000 serious adverse event reports within three months of rolling out its covid shot, but here we will focus on table 6 of the data on pregnant and lactating women who received the shots in the first few months of the rollout, which began december 11. Most of these women would have been healthcare workers because that was who the first rounds of shots went to. As the clinical trials preceding the rollout excluded pregnant women, these would have been the first pregnant and lactating women to have ever received the vaccines. According to table 6, 270 unique pregnancies were exposed to the vaccine, and of those, no outcome was provided for 238 pregnancies, leaving 32 with known outcomes. According to pfizers report, there were 23 spontaneous abortions, a term for miscarriage, along with two premature births with neonatal death, two miscarriages with intrauterine death, one spontaneous abortion with neonatal death, and a single pregnancy with a normal outcome. As mcgovern notes: that means that of 32 pregnancies with known outcome, 28 resulted in fetal death. The vaccine makers report also noted that there were five other pregnancies with outcome pending in addition to the 238 with no outcome provided. However, 32 minus 28 equals four, not five. Mcgovern said she contacted pfizers media representative to ask about the figures: were 28 of 32 known pregnancy outcomes actually fatal in the first 10 weeks that the vaccine became available, as their report suggests? Thats an 87.5% pregnancy loss rate? And only one pregnancy outcome was normal? Please correct me if im wrong about this. She says she never got a reply to emailed questions or to phone calls. Noting that the food and drug administration would have had the information by the end of april, mcgovern was left to conclude it wasnt any wonder why pfizer wanted to hide its safety data for at least five-and-a-half decades, and maybe more. The spike in adverse vaccine-related miscarriage and stillborn births are not just limited to the united states, they are increasing wherever the pfizer vax is used, including canada. A retired doctor in british columbia, dr. Mel bruchet, noted in november that he was informed by doulas that there were 13 stillbirths over a 24-hour period at the lions gate hospital in vancouver (according to definitions online, a doula is a trained companion who is not a healthcare professional and who supports another person through a significant health-related experience, such as childbirth, miscarriage, induced abortion or stillbirth, or non-reproductive experiences such as dying). One grandmother whose grandbaby was stillborn at the hospital claimed on twitter: my daughter got that damned poison vaccine one month ago because she couldnt go to a restaurant, and people were freaking out because that she was unvaxxed. I want to sue the government. The platform removed the message because twitter is just a propaganda outlet for the global tyrannical regime. But what is clear, just based on the early information pfizer has been forced to release, the vaccine should not be given to pregnant women, period.																
312	0	Dr. David martin: covid vaccines are bioweapons designed for genocide 03/30/2022 / by mary villareal dr. David martin has warned the public that a genocide is currently going on in the guise of mass vaccination. This is a pandemic of the bio weaponization of the human organism. This is not public health. And anthony fauci is the architect of this genocide, martin said when he appeared in the march 24 episode of the stew peters show. During the course of the program, martin talked about the chimeric model of spike proteins and how this is affecting the body. Mainstream science has come up with the news that the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccines persist in the human body for an indeterminate period, and will survive up to eight weeks in the lymphatic system, where it will continually produce the spike protein. Scientists see evidence that spike proteins are showing up in waste streams at alarmingly high rates. This is what happens when you inject the body with a chimeric model of a synthetic spike protein, and when this type of gene therapy has not been tested properly. It turns out that no one knows how long each vaccinated individual injected would manufacture the pathogens in their body. Why are there such high concentrations of spike protein showing up in waste streams? The reason is really simple, martin said. The human organism is now being modified and it is being modified to perpetually produce a toxic protein known and scheduled to harm humanity. (related: karen kingston tells michele swinick: purpose of covid-19 vaccine is to be a tool for genetic editing  brighteon. Tv. ) martin added that these proteins are known to be damaging and are subject to the biological and chemical weapons, treaties and laws that have been enforced in the united states. These chimeric viruses resulted from the deliberate manipulation of sars-cov-2, to incorporate nucleic acids into the virus, which is illegal. With the fourth covid-19 shot now underway in the u. S. , fauci is talking about possibly doing another round of lockdowns, and it seems that plenty of americans will participate because many have been brainwashed by the so-called experts. Sars-cov-2 chimeric viruses a result of deliberate manipulation sars-cov-2 chimeric viruses are a result of any deliberate manipulation of the virus to incorporate nucleic acids for sars-cov-2 virulence factors. This actually shows up in three sections of the code of federal regulations subjected to the biologic and toxin agent program defined under chapter 18 u. S. Code section 178. As a biological agent, it is also subjected to 18 u. S. Code section 175, or the prohibition of biological weapons. The statute says that what big pharma is doing under the direction of fauci is a felony punishable up to 99 years in prison and up to $100 million per count. The statement of the authorities are so egregious in the matter that there is no need to make up a conspiracy because everything they did was recorded and published. According to martin, they are also in violation of criminal conspiracy and racketeering laws and have admitted to it. According to filings by vaccine manufacturer pfizer, there is no current precedent for an mrna based immunotherapy, such as the type we are developing, being approved for sale by the fda [food and drug administration], the european commission or any other regulatory agency elsewhere in the world. This is not a public health vaccine. This is a computer-generated synthetic chimeric alternative to the virulence factor of sars-cov-2, martin insisted. This is the reality that says we are being subjected to a perpetual addiction to a known pathogen and toxic agent. And the reason why anthony fauci is now advocating for the next round of boosters. (related: drs. Peter daszak and anthony fauci must be arrested, as new intel emerges documenting planned coronavirus enhancement and deployment. ) meanwhile, documents revealed that zoologist peter daszak and his collaborators have planned to release nanoparticles that could penetrate the skin. These particles contain novel chimeric spike proteins from bat coronaviruses, that can penetrate the skin when enhanced. The documents further revealed that covid-19 is more than a virus. It is a biological weapon that was strategically developed and slated for deployment. They also planned to create chimeric viruses, genetically enhanced to infect humans more easily, and requested $14m from the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) to fund the work. Darpa turned down the application. Daszak is the president of ecohealth alliance, a nonprofit organization that received funding from faucis national institute of allergy and infectious diseases to study bat coronaviruses with scientists at the wuhan institute of virology.																
313	0	Fetal deaths up by nearly 2,000% since start of covid vaccine rollout 04/08/2022 / by mary villareal a member of americas frontline doctors has warned pregnant women that the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccine rollout has coincided with the nearly 2,000 percent increase in fetal deaths. Dr. Peterson pierre presented data regarding the rate of fetal death per vaccine administered in the u. S. , and it showed a spike in cases since the covid-19 vaccines were made available. He also noted that the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recorded 550 million administered covid shots, with 3,725 fetal deaths. This means that there had been one fetal death for every 147,651 shots. In contrast, there had been four billion administered shots for other vaccines in the years 2006 through 2019, with 1,368 fetal deaths, or one fetal death for every 3 million shots. So if you do the math, you realize that since the covid shots have been available, theres been a 1,925 percent increase in fetal deaths, he said. He also urged expecting mothers to take note of the numbers for the sake of the children. Unfortunately, the data seems irrelevant because the recommendation to get [covid] shots has not changed, pierre noted. You need to look out for your own kids. You are their protector. You have a lot to think about. That decision rests with you, not with anyone else. Around 23 of 32 expecting mothers receiving pfizer covid vaccines resulted in spontaneous abortions or miscarriages, according to the pfizer and food and drug administration (fda) response to the freedom of information act as reported last year. Also seen is a more than 50 times increase in ectopic pregnancy, which also results in fetal death. Most pregnant women dont notice symptoms of ectopic pregnancy early, because while it does present the usual signs and symptoms of pregnancy, it cannot continue as normal, with the fertilized egg growing in an improper place. In canada, the lions gate hospital said they would usually see one stillborn death a month, but in november last year there had been 13 stillborn deaths in a 24-hour period. The cdc also reported that the covid shots have effects on fertility problems, acknowledging that the results from ongoing long-term studies are not yet available. Experts warn expectant mothers against getting mrna covid vaccines medical experts have long warned expectant mothers against getting the mrna shots, including vaccine expert pamela acker and former pfizer executive michael yeadon, who said that women of childbearing age, especially those who are pregnant or nursing, should reject the covid-19 vaccines entirely. You never ever give inadequately tested medicines, medicinal products, to a pregnant woman, yeadon said. Despite the evidence pointing to the dangers of mrna shots to unborn children, the cdc still recommends that people ages 18-49 with certain medical conditions, including pregnancy, receive mrna covid-19 shots, including a booster dose, based on their individual risks and benefits. The governments own database through march 18, showed unprecedented increases in recorded deaths and injuries following covid-19 vaccines for the past 15 months since they were rolled out for emergency use. Statistics showed massive increases in reported adverse effects from strokes (68,000 percent), heart diseases (44,000 percent) and deaths (6,800 percent). In fact, the majority of cases found in the over 31 years of history with the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) are from december 2020, when the fda granted the emergency use of covid-19 vaccines. Data from different surveillance systems did not indicate obvious safety signals with regards to pregnancies or neonatal outcomes associated with the vaccinations. However, experts do suggest further studies with regard to fetal deaths associated with the vaccines, especially for women who have been vaccinated early in their pregnancy. Visit immunization.

314	0	Pfizer, moderna mrna vaccines trigger aids-like syndrome 04/13/2022 / by ethan huff autoimmune disease is spiking in the fully vaccinated, and many are now calling the collection of ailments associated with it aids-like syndrome. An eight-year-old boy from bongara, peru, as one example, was recently diagnosed with stevens-johnson syndrome (sjs) just days after receiving his second dose of pfizers wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccine. Sjs is said to be extremely rare, but the boy, named richard jefferson bustamante bautista, developed it after getting his second injection of pfizers experimental mrna drug. Stevens-johnson syndrome (sjs) is a rare, serious disorder of the skin and mucous membranes, the mayo clinic reported. Its usually a reaction to medication that starts with flu-like symptoms, followed by a painful rash that spreads and blisters. Excess deaths overall are also up big time among young people ever since the jabs were introduced. Edward dowd, formerly of blackrock, warned that what is currently transpiring can be compared to the vietnam war for todays millennial generation. Young people between the ages of 25 and 40 saw an 84 percent increase in excess mortality last fall, which dowd said is the worst-ever excess mortality, i think, in history. Excess deaths among millennials were higher than any other age group last year, and a whopping seven times higher than the silent generation, which includes people over the age of 85. Not surprising is the fact that this increase directly coincided with the jab mandates and subsequent approval of booster shots for the fauci flu. Basically, millennials experienced a vietnam war in the second half of 2021, dowd said during a recent interview, noting that 58,000 people died in the conflict. Are the fully vaccinated all quietly developing aids? While the world has been distracted with the conflict between russia and ukraine, the government of the united kingdom quietly published data showing that people who are triple vaccinated are now just weeks away from developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids), if they have not developed it already. The reason for this is explained in the stanford study, which explains that the spike protein in covid-19 injections is lentivirus, which contains a combination of hiv types 1-3, srv/1 (aids), mers and sars. The best-known lentivirus is the human immune deficiency pathogen, which causes aids, which explains why we are now seeing autoimmune disease and neurodegenerative decline occur following covid injection. The mrna from the lentivirus cocktail, which is found in the vaccine, is being inserted into the dna of human cells through an invasive procedure (injection), permanently changing the genome of cells. This devastating condition is also known as prion disease. Then there is aphasia, a post-injection condition that recently caused 67-year-old hollywood actor bruce willis to retire, ending his career. Aphasia is a common side effect caused by covid injections, and is associated with brain fog and failure to concentrate. Aphasia leaves a person unable to communicate effectively with others, explained johns hopkins medicine about the language disorder, which affects specific areas of the brain associated with language expression and comprehension. Many people have aphasia as a result of stroke, the resource added. Stroke, by the way, along with myocarditis and other forms of cardiovascular illness, is another common adverse effect associated with covid injections. It is occurring in many otherwise healthy young people following the injections. Its five minutes past midnight, wrote someone at infowars. Wake up: they are murdering us via untested, warp speed covid-19 vaccines. Instead of coming out with an actual aids vaccine, fauci came up with a vaccine to give you aids, wrote another.																
315	0	Since covid vaccines were introduced, fifa football (soccer) deaths have increased by 300% 04/22/2022 / by ethan huff between march 2021 and march 2022, more than 769 fully vaccinated athletes have collapsed on the field, many of them due to cardiac arrest and other serious issues caused by wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) jabs. The group good sciencing, which is comprised of investigators, news editors, journalists and truth seekers, has tracked an even higher number than that since the beginning of operation warp speed. Good sciencing says that there have been at least 890 major incidents, including 579 deaths, caused by fauci flu shots. In fifa football alone, the daily expose (u. K. ) further found, deaths in 2021 increased by 300 percent. The death figure that year was four times higher than the average rate of death recorded in the sport between 2009 and 2020, with the number of deaths in december 2021 alone equaling the annual average for the past 12 years. With cases like these becoming impossible to ignore, even a mainstream media sports channel in australia speculated that the health issues could be linked to covid-19 shots, and one of the hosts acknowledged that multiple players have suffered from heart issues and bells palsy following covid-19 booster shots, the expose explains. The war in ukraine is a convenient distraction from covid jab injuries, deaths it was dr. Joseph mercola who provided this and other information to the expose, including data from the one america news network (oan) showing that the average age of a jabbed athlete suffering cardiac arrest is just 23 years old. In early april of 2022, the miami open made headlines after 15 players, all of whom had recently gotten injected for the chinese virus, had to drop out of the tournament. Among these were favorites such as paula badosa and jannik sinner, the latter of whom had to bend over on the court during a match, which his opponent said was very strange. Even some of the fans were confused, one of them asking, what is going on? The answer is that so-called vaccines are going on, and the damage they are causing to otherwise healthy athletes can no longer be ignored. How many 23-year-old athletes were collapsing and suffering heart attacks before this year? Asked oans pearson sharp. Do you know of any 23-year-old people who had heart attacks before now? And these are just the ones we know about. How many have gone unreported? Nearly 800 athletes  young, fit people in the prime of life  falling down on the field. In fact, 500 percent more soccer players in the eu are dropping dead from heart attacks than just one year ago. Sharp went on to explain that the pfizer injection is known to cause heart inflammation, so is any of this really a surprise? Many of the doctors treating these injured players are also linking the outcome to the injections, which is not a coincidence, sharp maintains. Another strange phenomenon being reported is a major uptick in hepatitis cases among children who recently got injected for the wuhan disease. Liver damage is yet another deadly side effect of the jabs, though the media is refusing to put two and two together. To think the media span emma raducanus breathing issues at r4 wimbledon as a panic attack, wrote a commenter at the expose about another athlete incident that the media is trying to deflect from the injections. She has lost several games since then and has never remotely looked upset or close to panic attack. Poor lass was so close to a cardiac arrest its frightening. The jabs have demonstrably failed and are dangerous and ineffective. The media have switched to the contrived conflict in ukraine and the sheep have obliged them. Nothing to see here ...

316	0	Cardiovascular emergencies in israel increased by 25% after covid-19 vaccine rollout 05/01/2022 / by arsenio toledo a recently published study from israel has confirmed a strong correlation between a massive increase in emergency cardiovascular events among people under 40 and the beginning of the countrys wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) mass vaccination program. The study, published in the peer-reviewed open access journal scientific reports, was conducted by two researchers from the massachusetts institute of technologys sloan school of management with the help of dr. Eli jaffe, deputy director of the magen david adom, israels national emergency medical service (ems). The researchers evaluated data from the magen david adom from 2019 to 2021. Specifically, they studied data concerning emergency calls among 16- to 39-year-olds all over israel with potential factors including covid-19 infection and vaccination rates. This investigation found a 25 percent increase in emergency calls between january to may 2021, compared with the same time in 2019 and 2020. This coincides with the beginning of israels covid-19 mass vaccination program, which began in late dec. 2020 and primarily used pfizers experimental and deadly mrna vaccine. The weekly emergency call counts were significantly associated with the rates of 1st and 2nd vaccine doses administered to this age group but were not with covid-19 infection rates, wrote the researchers. While not establishing causal relationships, the findings raise concerns regarding vaccine-induced undetected severe cardiovascular side-effects and underscore the already established causal relationship between vaccines and myocarditis, a frequent cause of unexpected cardiac arrest in young individuals. Higher covid-19 infection rates do not increase risk of heart complications the researchers noted that their study aligns with previous investigations that found the overall incidence rate of heart complications like cardiac arrest were not always associated with higher covid-19 infection rates at a population level. There was also no connection between hospitalization rates for myocardial infarctions with the initial covid-19 wave compared to pre-pandemic baselines in israel. These results also are mirrored by a report of increased emergency department visits with cardiovascular complaints during the vaccination rollout in germany as well as increased ems calls for cardiac incidents in scotland, wrote the researchers. (related: large nordic study finds that mrna covid vaccines increase risk of myocarditis. ) another study, carried out by researchers from sweden and investigating populations in four nordic countries, confirmed that it was more common for people to experience heart inflammation requiring hospital care if they received covid-19 vaccines than if they remained unvaccinated. The researchers recommend that, when future studies evaluate possible side effects and outcomes of the covid-19 vaccine, officials should incorporate ems data and other relevant information to identify potential new health trends, including an increase in ems calls following covid-19 mass vaccination programs, and promptly investigate potential underlying causes. Unfortunately, despite confirming that the covid-19 vaccine is responsible for an increased risk of experiencing heart complications, the research team still believed in its supposed benefits. They wrote that the benefits of covid-19 vaccination are clear, especially for populations at great risk of developing serious and potentially life-threatening illness. However, the researchers did concede that it is important to better understand the potential risks to minimize potential harm. Learn more about the connection between the covid-19 vaccines and heart complications by reading the latest articles at heart. News.

317	0	Harmful effects of covid-19 vaccines are best explained by micro blood clots: report 05/06/2022 / by jd heyes a column published this week addresses some of the most common harmful effects related to covid-19 illness and vaccines, including micro blood clots that appear to have been one of the earliest-known side effects. Dr. Joel s. Hirschhorn, a former university of wisconsin tenured professor, as well as a senior official at the congressional office of technology assessment and the national governors association who has provided testimony at over 50 house and senate hearings, wrote at lifesite news that the clots seem to be the likely cause of millions of health impacts and deaths from covid infection as well as from covid vaccines, and even millions of long covid victims suffering diverse health problems with no apparent medical solution. Long covid, for those who are unfamiliar with the term, refers to lasting, recurring effects from a covid illness that can stretch for months or even years. What should receive far greater attention is the formation of microscopic blood clots throughout bodies caused by spike proteins. These are not found through conventional medical scanning and imaging technologies, he began. Know this: they result from covid spike proteins that screw up fine blood vessels, causing micro blood clots. The spike protein molecules from covid infection are the same as what happens when covid vaccines pump huge numbers of them into your body. So, vaccines create the same blood clot problem as covid itself in many people, he added. In particular, hirschorns lengthy piece addresses these three major themes: 1. Vaccine adverse health impacts, including deaths 2. A broad array of covid infection illnesses and deaths 3. Millions of people with long covid suffering diverse health problems. Micro clots can cause a range of issues and problems, hirschorn noted, and they are difficult if not impossible to detect ahead of time. But by becoming lodged in the tiniest of blood vessels, they can still cause heart attacks and strokes, while also creating other circulatory problems. Hirschorn went on to cite dr. Peter mccollough, who he said addressed the issue of micro blood clots earlier in the pandemic. Mccollough noted that the spike protein itself caused coagulation or blood clotting. And a unique type of coagulation. It caused the red blood cells to stick together. At the same time, the platelets stick together. So this is a very different type of blood clotting than we would see with major blood clots in the arteries and veins. The professor and healthcare expert also cited dr. Charles hoffe, a canadian physician who went public with findings regarding micro clots in july 2021: using the d-dimer test of blood, he found that 62% of hundreds of his vaccinated patients had high numbers, indicating the presence of micro blood clots. A d-dimer test measures the amount of degraded fibrin in the blood. He did more than just release that finding. He said that the use of mrna vaccines would kill most people through heart failure. Hirschorn went on to explain how and why spike proteins are hazardous and dangerous over the short and long term, and how they contribute to clotting. Here is what you need to understand: though the claim has long been that these spike proteins act as a deterrent to viral infection after being injected into a persons body, the reality is that they actually become part of the cell wall of a persons vascular endothelium or linings of the blood vessels, he wrote. In very small diameter blood vessels, the spikes have a big impact on blood flow. Notes brian bull, md, a pathologist and former dean of the loma linda university school of medicine, who studied the spike protein and clotting phenomenon early on: this could change our approach to fighting this disease because we may have been looking in the wrong place. We have been looking for a treatment against a viral disease, but we should now also look for therapy for a viral disease that has transformed into a clotting disorder.																
318	0	Top 7 complications linked to pfizer, moderna, and j&j covid gene mutation injections 05/11/2022 / by s. D. Wells theres only one reason people would accept high risk of getting injured or killed by a vaccine as a tradeoff for a virus that only kills .01 percent of the population. That reason is that they have no idea just how dangerous the jab really is. People all over the world who are prone to blood clots are still getting wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) gene therapy injections because the cdc covers up the fact that thousands of micro blood clots caused directly by the vaccines are not uncommon. Healthy athletes, military members, teens and children are suffering from irregular heart rhythms right after getting jabbed for the fauci flu. These heart palpitations are very dangerous and can lead directly to a heart attack or stroke. Billions of spike protein nanoparticles spread throughout vascular system, then immune system tries to attack them all planning on having a baby? If a woman is pregnant and gets a fauci flu jab, the toxic prions spread throughout her body through her blood, even reaching the fetus. Then the immune system recognizes all of these deadly prions as foreign enemies and stages an attack. The cdc told the world that the jabs are intramuscular, meaning they stay in the immediate muscle area where they are injected, but that was a huge lie. Thats why most pregnant women, no matter what term of pregnancy they are in, will involuntarily abort (miscarry) the baby after getting protein prion injections. Thats one reason the fauci flu shots are nicknamed the new morning after pill. Cancer is the uncontrolled multiplication of mutated cells that infect the blood and vital organs, just like protein prions from covid jabs when cancer spreads throughout the blood and organs, its because the replication mechanism in your cells is broken, and they are reproducing mutations out of control. When you get injected with mrna technology, your cells now have permanent instructions to create toxic virus-mimicking prions forever, and your immune system realizes your blood and organs are being invaded. Thats when your body creates tumors to try to contain all these enemies, but most people just keep eating food toxins, feeding the nightmare, just like mrna keeps producing toxic prions. These injections also cause cancer tumors. Still think the contrived benefits outweigh the risks? We think not. Make no mistake, acute allergic reactions to mrna jabs are not uncommon, but rather very common. Anaphylaxis causes the immune system to release a flood of chemicals, causing blood pressure to plummet and the person goes into shock. Breathing can quickly become completely obstructed, causing death. Anaphylaxis is fatal for 1 to 2 percent of people who experience it. In a massive study of all the fda/cdc approved covid-19 gene therapy injections, acute allergic reactions were reported for 1365 patients of the 64,900 that got jabbed, and 16 of those people experienced anaphylaxis from pfizers jab, and 9 from modernas (male and female). And how long after the injection did they go into anaphylaxis shock? Just 17 minutes later. The covid-19 jabs are nothing short of a death sentence for millions of people with serious preexisting conditions, meaning diabetes, obesity, cancer, heart disease, dementia, and the list goes on. If you dont believe that the fauci flu jabs are population reduction tools, then ask yourself why the cdc pushes so hard for the immune-compromised to get the shots, when they are the ones at the most risk of dying directly from them. Top 7 complications directly caused by pfizer, moderna, and j&j covid gene mutation injections 1. Micro blood clots 2. Myocarditis (irregular heart rhythms) 3. Involuntary abortions (miscarriages) 4. Cancer tumors 5. Anaphylaxis 6. Exacerbated pre-existing conditions (diabetes, arthritis, allergies) 7. Death bookmark vaccines.

319	0	6 elderly residents at palo alto nursing home dead within a week after getting injected with covid vaccines 05/18/2022 / by ramon tomey nine residents of a nursing home in california were injected with the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccine. Of these nine, six passed away within a week of vaccination. Entrepreneur steve kirsch revealed this news in a post on his substack. One of his friends alerted him to the deaths, after an anonymous individual sent an excerpt of a private conversation to the latter about the incident. According to the anonymous senders excerpt, the stepmother of one of the parties in the exchange was a resident of a palo alto, california nursing home. Nine residents, including the stepmother, had received the covid-19 vaccine. Soon after, six residents died  the stepmother among them. All six died within a week after the [covid-19] shot. Perfectly normal for a safe vaccine, right? The chance that this was simply bad luck is less than one in 12 billion, remarked kirsch. The entrepreneur divulged that he knows the name of the aforementioned nursing home, but refused to reveal it in his post. I want to give them time to notify the public of this themselves. That would be the right thing to do. But they wont do that, will they? This is why we never hear of these deaths. Nobody wants to talk about it. Kirsch also sought an explanation of the incident from different federal officials  including three officials at the centers for disease control and prevention, steven anderson of the food and drug administrations office of biostatistics and epidemiology and rep. Anna eshoo (d-ca). He also sent emails to local officials, such as california state sen. Josh becker and santa clara county supervisor joe simitian. Only matt savage, a staffer in simitians office, replied to kirschs queries. Kirsch wrote in his emails: something caused all those people to die. Something killed these people, and it is precisely correlated with the time of the vaccine administration. If the vaccine didnt cause these deaths, then what did? (related: nearly 10% of connecticut nursing home residents killed by covid outbreak, even with an almost 100% vaccination rate. ) other nursing homes had issues following covid-19 vaccination while the post-vaccination deaths at the palo alto nursing home did not make it to the news, other similar incidents were documented. Auburn, new york-based nursing home the commons at saint anthony had no covid-19 deaths prior to dec. 29, 2020. But on dec. 22  three days before christmas  the facility began vaccinating residents. Three residents died on dec. 29 after getting injected, with the death toll climbing to 24 as of jan. 10, 2021. Ron paul institute for peace and prosperity senior fellow adam dick commented on the post-vaccination deaths at the commons: things seem to be working backwards at the commons. Vaccinating people is supposed to reduce or end [covid-19] deaths, but at [the nursing home], such deaths are reported to have occurred only after residents began receiving [covid-19] vaccinations. Is the timing just a strange coincidence? Later in january 2021, a certified nursing assistant (cna) named james published a video where he talked out about how the covid-19 vaccine causes more damage to patients than the virus it seeks to address. According to him, very few residents in the nursing home he works on caught covid-19 and none of them died in the entirety of 2020. But the horrors began after the nursing home began covid-19 vaccination using the pfizer mrna vaccine. Fourteen residents died within two weeks following vaccination, and many others are nearing death. Theyre dropping like flies, james said in the video. He added that those residents who did not die from the covid shots ended up being in worse health than before. Residents who used to walk on their own lost the ability to do so, while those who could carry on an intelligent conversation with him could no longer talk. James called upon other cnas, nurses and family members to tell the world the truth about the covid-19 vaccines dangers, saying: how many more lives need to be lost before we say something? Vaccinedeaths. Com has more stories about people dying after getting covid-19 vaccines. Watch the video of james, the whistleblower cna, revealing how nursing home residents are dropping like flies after getting vaccinated.																
320	0	Autopsy confirms british mother died of acute myocarditis after receiving pfizer covid shot 05/20/2022 / by ramon tomey an autopsy in the u. K. Confirmed that a healthy mother of two died of acute myocarditis almost two weeks after getting the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccine from pfizer. According to the daily mail, pathologist dr. Sukhvinder ghataura scrutinized the findings of a post-mortem examination and toxicology report for dawn wooldrige, who died on june 15, 2021. Medical records showed wooldridge, mother of a five-year-old boy and a two-year-old girl, received her first dose of the pfizer covid-19 vaccine on june 4. An earlier autopsy proved to be inconclusive. Eleven days after wooldridge got her first covid-19 vaccine dose, she was found dead in her home by her brother. Emergency services were called in and paramedics attempted to revive her, but in vain as the 36-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene. She had dropped her son off at school in the morning, visited a friend and had spoken to her mother earlier that day  but failed to pick up her son from school. Basing his analysis on the medical reports, ghataura said wooldridge had been healthy at the time of her death and did not have any signs of alcohol or drugs in her system. The medical report noted heart inflammation, as well as fluid and a small blood clot in her lungs  alongside menstrual irregularity and pain in the arm and jaw following the vaccine. These signs, he suggested, were linked to myocarditis or heart muscle inflammation. On the balance of probabilities, she had vaccine-related problems. There is nothing else for me to hang my hat on. It is the most likely reason, in my conclusion. It is more than likely dawn died in response to the covid-19 [vaccine], ghataura told coroner alison mccormick. Mccormick said: during the course of the evidence, [ghataura] expressed a change of view. It is more likely than not she died from acute myocarditis. I give the narrative conclusion that her death was caused by acute myocarditis due to recent covid-19 [vaccination]. Pfizer shot causes both parents and children to suffer from myocarditis the findings came as a shock to dawns family. Her husband ashley, brother stuart lynch, sister-in-law and step-parents were in attendance during the inquest held in the town of reading in england. Lynch asked ghataura if dawn would still be alive if she did not get the covid-19 vaccine, to which the pathologist replied in the affirmative. Its a difficult question, but i would say yes. I wish to pass on my condolences to [her] family, answered ghataura. The coroner turned to ashley, telling him: you will have something to say to your children to explain why their mother died so tragically. He echoed this in a subsequent statement: when [our children] are old enough, i want to have enough of an explanation about how their [mother] died. The only thing that happened when dawn died was that she had her covid-19 [vaccine] before her death. The pfizer mrna covid-19 vaccine has been linked to several cases of myocarditis  with most occurring in young males. Toronto resident dan hartman said his son sean was among those who died of heart muscle inflammation following the vaccine. Sean, who was only 17 when he tragically died, was also healthy like dawn and had no underlying medical conditions. (related: toronto man says pfizers covid-19 vaccine killed his healthy, athletic 17-year-old son. ) according to the elder hartman, sean received his first vaccine dose on aug. 25. He experienced a rash all over his neck and face and brown circles around his eyes. Doctors at a hospital he visited on aug. 29 prescribed him ibuprofen for the vaccine-induced reactions. On the morning of sept. 27, his mother found him dead on the floor beside his bed. All he wanted to do was to play hockey, shared seans father. He took a year off for covid and he got extremely bored sitting in his bedroom. He decided to go back to hockey this year, and to do that he had to have a vaccination to play. The grieving parents ordered an autopsy on sean to find out why he died. An initial autopsy determined the cause of death as unascertained, but it revealed that sean had a slightly enlarged heart even though he had no heart condition. A second doctor who chose to remain anonymous told the hartmans that myocarditis caused by the vaccine was the main cause of death. I know in my heart and soul, i believe the second pathologist that the vaccine killed my son. Its not as rare as everyone thinks it is, dan said. Vaccinedeaths.

321	0	Mass die-off: close to 180,000 died within 60 days of covid-19 vaccination  england statistics office makes stunning admission 05/22/2022 / by belle carter the office for national statistics (ons) in england revealed that a total of 69,466 people died within 28 days and 178,874 people died within 60 days of getting injected with the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) vaccine between january 2021 and march 2022. Ons published the data on deaths by vaccination status on may 16. The report included a chart titled number of deaths within 28 days of covid-19 vaccination in england. The total fatalities were broken down to 7,953 people who died positive for the virus and 61,513 people who expired due to other causes within 28 days of vaccination. During the same timeframe, a total of 14,049 people died from coronavirus and a total of 164,825 people died from other causes within 60 days of vaccination. The data was released following dozens of freedom of information inquiries made to various government institutions requesting to know the number of people who died after receiving the jabs. (related: cdc hides covid data from the public in order to whitewash dishonest covid narrative. ) moreover, the u. K. Health security agencys vaccine surveillance report indicated that 92 percent of all the pandemic-related deaths in england in march were among the vaccinated population. Governments manipulated data to heighten covid-19 pandemic dr. Norman fenton, risk information management professor at queen mary university of london, criticized the governments around the world for manipulating the covid-19 pandemic data when he guested on the defender podcast. It was clear from the start that most of the data that governments put out  not just the uk government, but most governments around the world  were kind of misleading because it was based on very easily manipulated statistics, fenton told the host robert f. Kennedy, jr. Throughout the pandemic, fenton closely examined and criticized how officials used data to make decisions about lockdowns, testing and vaccines. He pointed out that there was an immediate rush to draw conclusions, which were sort of based on over-simplistic data on case numbers and deaths. The problem was that data were very easily used by influencers and decision-makers to fit particular narratives that exaggerated the scale of the crisis. Fentons team published some of the first research providing more accurate estimates about the infection rate versus the fatality rate compared with official estimates that he said were based on faulty data. The research showed the virus was more widespread than people assumed, but nowhere near as dangerous as was being claimed. Further in the show, he also addressed some concerns on the faulty polymerase chain reaction (pcr) tests. We were initially led to believe that the pcr test was an accurate diagnostic test. But later, of course, we discovered that wasnt true. And the impact of that has been catastrophic, he said. The use of pcr tests was also misguided since the tests are inherently fraudulent, and were never intended or designed to function as a diagnostic tool for the disease. Kennedy agreed, saying the the magnitude of the pandemic was enormously and deceptively amplified by the misuse of the pcr test. He added that the information concerning deaths following vaccination also was manipulated as part of the official claim that the vaccine was the only way to keep people from becoming seriously ill and dying. Data adjusted to take into account misclassification shows a peak in mortality shortly after vaccination. Now, of course, it could well be that these are people who are indeed immunosuppressed seriously. Also, the vaccination might just be bringing forward the death, which wouldve occurred shortly afterward anyway, kennedy said. Still, the fact remains that hundreds of thousands if not millions have died shortly after getting injected with the covid-19 vaccine. Visit pandemic.

322	0	Reports of deaths and serious injuries from the covid-19 jabs mount by the day. As of june 11, 2021, the u. S. Vaccine adverse events reporting system (vaers) had posted 358,379 adverse events, including 5,993 deaths and 29,871 serious injuries in the european unions database of adverse drug reactions from covid shots, called eudravigilance, there were 1,509,266 reported injuries, including 15,472 deaths as of june 19, 2021. Eudravigilance only accepts reports from eu members, so it covers only 27 countries. Remarkably, about half of all reported injuries  753,657  are listed as serious the british yellow card system had, as of june 9, 2021, received 276,867 adverse event reports following covid vaccination, including 1,332 deaths before you make the decision to participate in this unprecedented health experiment, it may be wise to assess your personal insurance and financial ability to handle a serious injury, as pandemic vaccine manufacturers are indemnified against lawsuits if you are injured by a covid shot and live in the u. S. , your only recourse is to apply for compensation from the countermeasures injury compensation act (cicp). Payouts are rare, cover only lost wages and unpaid medical bills, cannot be appealed, are capped around $370,000 for death, and require you to exhaust your private insurance before kicking in reports of deaths and serious injuries from the covid-19 jabs have been mounting with breakneck rapidity. Those who look at the numbers and have some awareness of historical vaccine injury rates agree weve never seen anything like it, anywhere in the world. While data can be hard to come by for some countries, the ones we can check reveal deeply troubling patterns.  United states  as of june 11, 2021, the u. S. Vaccine adverse events reporting system (vaers) had posted 358,379 adverse events,1 including 5,993 deaths and 29,871 serious injuries. In the 12- to 17-year-old age group, there were 271 serious injuries2 and seven deaths. Among pregnant women, there were 2,136 adverse events, including 707 miscarriages or premature births.3 all of these are bound to be undercounts as, historically, less than 10% of vaccine side effects are reported to vaers.4 an investigation by the u. S. Department of health and human services put it as low as 1%.5,6 be that as it may, the reported rate of death from covid-19 shots now exceeds the reported death rate of more than 70 vaccines combined over the past 30 years, and its about 500 times deadlier than the seasonal flu vaccine,7 which historically has been the most hazardous. The covid shots are also five times more dangerous than the pandemic h1n1 vaccine, which had a 25-per-million severe side effect rate.8,9 assuming the covid shots had the same side effect rate, and assuming some 200 million got the vaccine, the estimated number of people suffering a serious side effect would be about 5,000. Were well past that already, as 35,86410 people have been seriously injured or killed. Even though there are nearly 6,000 reported deaths in vaers, this number is likely seriously compromised. I recently interviewed dr. Vladimir zelenko, who has treated covid patients quite successfully, and we discussed the very distinct possibility that everyone who receives the covid jab may die from complications in the next two to three years. He personally knows of 28 covid jab deaths that were not accepted by vaers. Zelenko suspects the number of deaths may exceed 100,000 already. Getting the covid jab immediately places the injected individual in the very high risk of dying from covid. Most have the false assurance that they are protected, but in reality, they are far more vulnerable and as a result will not take very aggressive proactive measures to avoid dying from pathogenic priming or paradoxical immune enhancement before it is too late. Please be sure and make a notation in your calendar to review my groundbreaking interview with zelenko this sunday, july 4, 2021, which is only three days away. We will review protocols you can use to protect you and your family or those you love, who now regret getting the covid jab.  European union  in the european unions database of adverse drug reactions from covid shots, called eudravigilance, there were 1,509,266 reported injuries, including 15,472 deaths as of june 19, 2021.11 eudravigilance only accepts reports from eu members, so it covers only 27 of the 50 european countries. Remarkably, about half of all reported injuries  753,657  are listed as serious, meaning the injury is life-threatening, requires hospitalization, results in a medically important condition, significant disability or persistent incapacity.  U. K.  The british yellow card system had received, as of june 9, 2021, 276,867 adverse event reports following covid vaccination, including 1,332 deaths.12  israel  according to a report by the israeli people committee, a civilian body of health experts, there has never been a vaccine that has harmed as many people.13 for example, israeli data show boys and men between the ages of 16 and 24 who have been vaccinated have 25 times the rate of myocarditis (heart inflammation) than normal.14 (myocarditis is also affecting teens and young adults in the u. S. Although cdc officials say no confirmed deaths have been reported, at least two deaths have been linked temporally to the vaccine.15,16,17,18,19)  australia  in australia, two people have died from blood clots after taking astrazenecas covid shot. Meanwhile, only one person  an elderly woman  has died from covid-19 this year.20,21 if something goes wrong, youre on your own the pain and suffering these shots have already created is hard to imagine. Clearly, millions around the world have had their lives turned upside down by them. Many may not recover, physically or financially. Its really important to realize that if something goes wrong, youre largely on your own. Before you make the decision to participate in this unprecedented health experiment, it may be wise to assess your personal insurance and financial ability to handle a serious injury, as pandemic vaccine manufacturers are indemnified against lawsuits. You cannot sue them for damages. Nor can you sue the government or anyone else. If you are injured by a covid shot and live in the u. S. , your only recourse is to apply for compensation from the countermeasures injury compensation act (cicp), under which covid-19 vaccines are a covered countermeasure.22 the cicp is run by a sparsely staffed agency under the u. S. Department of health and human services. Details and hyperlinks to benefit request forms can be found in the congressional research services legal sidebar, compensation programs for potential covid-19 vaccine injuries.23 you cannot apply for and will not receive compensation from the national vaccine injury compensation program (vicp), which covers other vaccines, including the flu vaccine. Compensation from cicp is very limited and hard to get. In its 15-year history, it has paid out just 29 claims, fewer than 1 in 10.24,25,26 you only qualify if your injury requires hospitalization and results in significant disability and/or death, and even if you meet the eligibility criteria, it requires you to use up your private health insurance before it kicks in to pay the difference. The average cicp award is $200,000, and death cases are capped around $370,000. Meanwhile, you can easily rack up a $1 million hospital bill if you suffer a serious thrombotic event. Theres no reimbursement for pain and suffering, only lost wages and unpaid medical bills. This means a retired person cannot qualify even if they die or end up in a wheelchair. Salary compensation is of limited duration, and capped at $50,000 a year. On top of all that, you cannot appeal the cicps decision. Appeals simply get reviewed by another staff member in the same office. Can you afford a covid shot injury? Even if they can get it, cicp awards are likely to be a drop in the bucket for most people. The average award is $200,000, and death cases are capped at $370,376.27 meanwhile, you can easily rack up a $1 million hospital bill if you suffer a serious thrombotic event.28 you must also pay for your own legal help and any professional witnesses you may need to support your claim. In early june 2021, krdo news reported29 on the case of kendra lippy, a 38-year-old woman who had no health complaints prior to getting her johnson & johnson shot. Within a week, she developed headaches, abdominal pain and nausea. Her diagnosis: severe blood clots that progressed into multiple organ failure and coma. She had to have most of her small intestine removed and will need total parenteral nutrition for the rest of her life  a feeding method that bypasses her gastrointestinal tract. She was hospitalized for 33 days, including 22 days in the intensive care unit. She now needs occupational and physical therapy to regain basic functions like walking, writing and holding a fork. Lippys hospital bill already exceeds $1 million, a sum shell likely never be able to pay off, and theres no telling what kind of medical treatment shell need in years to come. Clearly lippy is headed for bankruptcy, and medical bills are the most common cause in the u. S. Additional stipulations that make payouts rare there are also time stipulations. You must file a request for benefits within one year of the date the vaccine was administered in order to qualify. This is a serious barrier, as serious side effects can take time to develop. For example, after the 2009 swine flu pandemic, people started reporting guillain-barre syndrome years after getting the pandemic h1n1 vaccine. At that point, they no longer qualified.30 worst of all, however, is the fact that it is now your responsibility to prove your injury was the direct result of the countermeasures administration based on compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientific evidence beyond mere temporal association. In other words, you basically have to prove what the vaccine developer itself has yet to ascertain, seeing how you are part of their still-ongoing study! The cicp is also notoriously secretive about why claims are approved or rejected. As reported by the insurance journal, it doesnt release even the most basic details such as the kinds of sicknesses people claim they got from vaccines.31 as of june 1, 2021, 1,360 americans had sought compensation from the cicp for injuries and deaths arising from pandemic countermeasures, but only 869 were deemed eligible to file a claim.32 none has been adjudicated. Professor peter meyers, a former director of the vaccine injury litigation clinic, who has referred to the cicp as a black hole process,33 warns that its a lousy program. He told life site news:34 its a secretive, opaque program whereby some unknown officials within the department of health and human services will make decisions; we dont know how many people are adjudicating, who they are, or what the process is. The secrecy means there are no official statistics on the types of injuries people are filing for, or what countermeasure is said to have caused their injury. By the way, vaccines are not the only countermeasures shielded from liability. Hospital treatment errors are shielded too, and we know some hospitals routinely killed patients, whether they had confirmed covid-19 or not, by placing them on ventilators even when they didnt need it.35 can you trust these white-collar criminals? As mentioned, pandemic vaccine makers are shielded from financial liability. The only way you can sue is if you can prove willful misconduct, such as deliberate deception, fraudulent behavior or hiding relevant information. To get around this, vaccine makers may simply not look for certain problems. The potential for infertility is a perfect example. The spike protein is suspected of having reproductive toxicity, and pfizers biodistribution data show it accumulates in womens ovaries.36 despite that, pfizer did not perform any reproductive toxicology tests. Since they didnt look, they can with a straight face say they didnt know the shot might cause reproductive failure. The thing is, they should have suspected it, and done the tests to make sure. Already, were seeing signs of reproductive toxicity. Data suggest the miscarriage rate among women who get the covid vaccine within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy is a whopping 82%. The normal rate is 10%, so this is no minor increase. Infertility will be far more difficult to ascertain, and could take decades.37 in a may 28, 2021, letter to the editor of the new england journal of medicine, drs. Ira bernstein and sanja jovanovic and deann mcleod, hbsc, of toronto, pointed this out by highlighting that preliminary safety studies published in the nejm in april 2021 were in error by including clinically unrecognized pregnancies in them.38 they included adjusted graphs reflecting this, and asked the studys authors to remove the erroneous data but, interestingly, their letter disappeared from the internet the last week of june, although it was still in wayback archives as of june 27, 2021. Coincidentally, june 17, 2021, the nejm republished the april study with no explanation as to why it was being republished and with no adjustments to the data. Considering the criminal history of pfizer, johnson & johnson and astrazeneca, its hard to understand how millions of people trust these companies not to lie in order to make a buck. As reported by life site news:39 just three main vaccine makers, pfizer, johnson & johnson and astrazeneca, have been ordered by state and federal courts to pay a combined more than $8.6 billion in fines to resolve dozens of allegations of criminal and civil misconduct. Pfizer alone was fined $2.3 billion  the largest such settlement in history, according to the department of justice  for willfully defrauding and misbranding its drugs that had already been yanked from shelves for their documented dangers. But for six whistleblowers who brought evidence forward against the company, it may have continued misbranding and selling its dangerous wares. Weve made a trade-off in america, said meyers, in giving vaccine manufacturers liability protection to ensure that they will keep making vaccines that, before legal immunity, were bogged down in lawsuit litigation for side effects. Manufacturers who make cars or ladders or other products can be sued if they are faulty. Vaccine makers have blanket liability to ensure their products are produced, government funding to produce them, ensured government orders for products, government-paid mass-marketing and mandates ... The tradeoff seems unfair today because the cicp program is such as flawed program, said meyers, particularly when vaccine companies are raking in colossal profits (pfizer is set to haul in $26 billion from its covid vaccines this year and covid vaccine manufacturing is churning out billionaires whose annual salaries are multiples of a decade of cicp payouts to dozens of people). The cicp benefits are stingy compensations, he added, for people who are suffering and waiting in the face of corporate greed and government opacity. Notwithstanding the drug companies criminal records, meyers thinks they would be crazy to risk misconduct. If it turned out that vaccine makers were actually hiding information on risks of covid vaccines, he said, it would be a catastrophe. ' are government and big pharma guilty of willful misconduct? I dont know about you, but the feeling i get when i look at the cascade of injuries and deaths occurring within days or in many cases mere hours after injection is that something is terribly amiss, and vaccine makers are sweeping it all under the rug. Isnt that willful misconduct? Failing to perform reproductive toxicology tests after they discover that spike protein accumulates in the ovaries  isnt that reprehensible willful misconduct? Continuing to claim that the mrna stays in the shoulder muscle when they have data showing it gets distributed into virtually all organs in the human body  isnt that hiding important information? Isnt that reprehensible willful misconduct? I would argue that government officials are also guilty of medical maleficence. As noted by dr. Robert malone, the inventor of the mrna and dna vaccine core platform technology,40 the most current version of the emergency use authorization (eua) that governs these covid shots reveals the fda opted not to require stringent post-vaccination data collection and evaluation, even though they had the power to do so. Again, if you dont look for injuries, youre unlikely to find them. If theres no robust data collection and review process, they can say the shots are safe and shuttle them through the licensing process far more easily. The problem theyre now facing is that vaers is getting such an overwhelming number of reports that even if they account for only 10% of actual injuries, or less, its absolutely unmistakable that there are serious problems. Failing to require vaccine makers to put together a comprehensive system to capture adverse event data is a sign of incompetence at best. But thats not all. The fda really starts appearing deceitful when refusing to acknowledge that the vaers reports indicate there are problems. To call coincidence more than 35,000 times is simply not believable, and to dismiss the risks of permanent disability and death as being worth it is beyond heartless, seeing how we have safe and effective treatments and no one actually needs to gamble their health on an experimental gene therapy. Covid shots are clearly riskier than advertised as noted in a june 22, 2021, wall street journal article,41 while vaers cannot tell us whether the shots were causative in any given side effect report, when you see clusters of reports that form a trend, its time to investigate. Four serious adverse effects that are currently trending are thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), noninfectious myocarditis (heart inflammation), especially in those under 30, deep-vein thrombosis and death.42 in order for such effects to be tolerable, even if rare, the vaccine (or drug) would need to be absolutely crucial for survival. Think of a highly infectious pandemic of ebola, for example  something where death is swift and virtually assured, and treatment, once infected, is ineffective. None of those criteria apply to covid-19, which has a lethality rate on par with the seasonal flu for all but the elderly and those most frail. The vaccine would also need to be an actual vaccine  something that provides immunity. Covid-19 gene therapy injections dont do that either. Overall, its clear that deaths and injuries from these shots are being swept under the rug, and we cannot allow that to continue. We must keep pushing for transparency, honesty and accountability. Remember, mark your calendar to view my groundbreaking interview with dr. Vladimir zelenko this sunday, which is only three days away. We will review protocols you can use to protect you and your family or those that you love who now regret getting the covid jab.																
323	0	This weeks number of reported deaths among all age groups following covid vaccines passed the 5,000 mark, up 759 from last week, according to data released today by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). The data comes directly from reports submitted to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers). Vaers is the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the u. S. Reports submitted to vaers require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed. Every friday, vaers makes public all vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date, usually about a week prior to the release date. Todays data show that between dec. 14, 2020 and may 28, a total of 294,801 total adverse events were reported to vaers, including 5,165 deaths  an increase of 759 over the previous week. There were 25,359 serious injuries reported, up 3,822 compared with last week. Among 12- to 17-year-olds, there were 40 reports of heart inflammation and 16 cases of blood clotting disorders. From the 5/28/21 release of vaers data. In the u. S. , 292.1 million covid vaccine doses had been administered as of may 28. This includes 123 million doses of modernas vaccine, 158 million doses of pfizer and 11 million doses of the johnson & johnson (j&j) covid vaccine. Of the 5,165 deaths reported as of may 28, 24% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination, 16% occurred within 24 hours and 38% occurred in people who became ill within 48 hours of being vaccinated. This weeks data for 12- to 17-year-olds show: this weeks total vaers data, from dec. 14, 2020, to may 28, 2021, for all age groups show: 17% of deaths were related to cardiac disorders. 52% of those who died were male, 45% were female and the remaining death reports did not include gender of the deceased. The average age of death was 74.4. As of may 28, 1,831 pregnant women reported adverse events related to covid vaccines, including 596 reports of miscarriage or premature birth. Of the 2,876 cases of bells palsy reported, 52% were reported after pfizer vaccinations, 41% following vaccination with the moderna vaccine and 253 cases, or 9%, of bells palsy cases were reported in conjunction with j&j. 280 reports of guillain-barre syndrome with 46% of cases attributed to pfizer, 40% to moderna and 20% to j&j. 83,684 reports of anaphylaxis with 40% of cases attributed to pfizers vaccine, 51% to moderna and 9% to j&j. 5,159 reports of blood clotting disorders. Of those, 2,213 reports were attributed to pfizer, 1,617 reports to moderna and 1,289 reports to j&j. Seven cases of heart inflammation reported in teen boys, new study shows on june 4, the defender reported seven boys between the ages of 14 and 19 in the u. S. Reportedly developed chest pain and heart inflammation within four days of receiving a second dose of the pfizer vaccine, according to a study published today in pediatrics. Heart imaging tests detected a rare type of heart muscle inflammation called myocarditis and pericarditis. None of the teens were critically ill but all were hospitalized. Only one of the seven boys in the pediatrics report displayed evidence of a possible previous covid infection, and doctors determined none of them had a rare inflammatory condition linked with covid or pre-existing conditions. It is possible myocarditis or pericarditis may be an additional rare adverse event related to systemic reactogenicity, but currently no causal association has been established between this vaccine and myopericarditis, the authors concluded. A search in vaers revealed 628 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, among all age groups reported in the u. S following covid vaccination between dec.14, 2020 and may 28. Of the 628 cases reported, 392 cases were attributed to pfizer, 206 cases to moderna and 27 cases to j&js covid vaccine. Of the 628 total cases of heart inflammation, 40 cases occurred in children ages 12 to 17, all attributed to pfizers covid vaccine. Israeli health officials find probable link between pfizer vaccine and heart inflammation as the defender reported june 2, israeli health officials found a probable link between pfizers covid vaccine  which the country has relied on almost exclusively in its vaccination drive  and dozens of cases of heart inflammation in young men following the second dose. A study by israeli health officials identified 275 cases of myocarditis in israel between december 2020 and may 2021, including 148 cases that occurred within a month after vaccination. Of those 148 cases, 27 occurred after the first dose and 121 after the second dose. About half of the cases involved people with previous medical conditions. Many of the cases were reported among men 16 to 30 years old, and most often in 16- to 19-year-olds. Most of the patients were discharged from the hospital in less than four days, and 95% of the cases were considered mild. New research shows covid vaccine spike protein travels from injection site on june 3, the defender reported on research obtained by a group of scientists showing the covid vaccine spike protein can travel from the injection site and accumulate in organs and tissues including the spleen, bone marrow, liver, adrenal glands and in quite high concentrations in the ovaries. Covid vaccine researchers had previously assumed mrna covid vaccines would behave like traditional vaccines.
